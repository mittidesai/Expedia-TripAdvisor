7,5940,2,50,25502,1,20,4.2,4.0,3.85," We chose this hotel, primarily because I got a good deal on it with Expedia, for a birthday shopping trip for my daughter.  We arrived at the published check-in time (3pm) only to learn from the front desk that our suite was not ready, however, the staff only needed an additional 30 minutes to get it ready, and provided us with a free coffee and pastry from the Starbucks in the lobby and free wifi for our stay for the inconvenience.  All in all, our stay at the Hilton Post Oak was great.*State of Texas LTC holders: This hotel has 30.06 and 30.07 signs posted at the entry points.  Good hotel at a great location. Shopping, restaurants and close to the freeways   This hotel is in a great location to the Galleria Mall and many yummy restaurants.  If you want this area of Houston, make sure and book this Hilton located on Post Oak versus the Hilton--Galleria (which is on the SW Freeway--and not exactly the Galleria area). This hotel also offers a shuttle that will take you to/from the businesses in the immediate area.  The staff was really nice....especially Brandon who works in the lobby/shuttle/valet area.  He was very accommodating.  There is a rooftop pool that sufficed, but I really wish the hotel would consider having a bartender in the bar at the pool (at least maybe on weekends when there are more guests) as there were at least 20 guests at the pool, and it was 100 degrees outside.  Drinks can be ordered and delivered from the hotel bar, but it took about 30 minutes, so we just walked to the bar and got them ourselves.  The indoor bartender was so sweet as well.  One other small complaint--I requested a universal adapter plug, but the front desk told us they were out of them.  An international hotel in an international city should have plenty of those in stock. But otherwise, it was a great stay.  The hotel appears to be newly renovated. The lobby was nice and lively at night.  room is dirty with cigarettes everywhere on balcony. Hair dry doesn't work. Outlets in bathroom doesn't work. Dirty cups are next to beds. I traveled with my 4 and 15 year old kids and no comfortable for them staying there   The front desk staff really wewe not that friendly and the rooms are very small and the beds are OLD.  The staff was great from the moment  we pulled in to valet. Then without any expectation we were automatically upgraded to a large two (2) King suite with plenty to extra SF. The breakfast was very nice along with the serving staff.  Nice room and great location for a competitive price  Everything was great except valet parking. No self parking. Very uninviting for guests and visitors.   Worst Hotel I ever stayed, the room had a dirty smell, the bed smelled like urine, there was no fridge or  microwave in the room and also no bottle of water to made coffee, you had to paid for the parking. just a bad hotel. it should be one start not four.  Had an awesome valentines night here! The view from the balcony was breathtaking and the bed was soooooo hard to get out of in the morning.  checked in around 11pm, room AC was set at 72 but showed 78, lowered the temp to 69 and went to bed around 1, fan was blowing so thought it will get cold, woke up several times at night and finally set the temp at 60. woke up at 4:30 and it was so hot, I was so tired that I just opened the balcony doors and went to sleep. woke up at 6ish, got ready and went to front desk to have us change rooms. Lady at front desk barely looked at me and said  ""oh I'm sorry"" and changed us to another room. No adjustments or anything for my inconvenience.  Every aspect of my stay exceeded expectations.  Stay and enjoy!  They charge $9.95 per night for WiFi and that is only good for 3 devices. They also charge 17.95 per night to self park in the garage and almost twice that for Valley service. (You don't really need vallet, the garage is convenient)The last hotel I stayed at (Wyndham Grand Pittsburgh), Vallet and WiFi were included.  Good hotel for stay, a nice to walking , best restaurants near , near to big shopping I had a nice stay  The location of this hotel is great, very close to the malls. Room was clean, some staff members were nice not all of them. I would rate this hotel between 3 stars and 4 stars   My stay was wonderful and the room was so comfortable and clean. The staff was so nice and helpful  Everything about the hotel was just fine except for check-in.  We got to town early (12:00)knowing that the room would probably not be ready. They told us to check back in about an hour and a half.  We shopped, visited family and came back at 4:00 and the room had still not been inspected so we could get in and change for an event at 6:00. Had to keep checking back with the desk every 10 minutes.  Finally got in and from then on, everything was fine.  I love this hotel, this was my 2nd time staying at this hotel - close to the Galleria and other shops  Good location, the hotel was average.Rooms ok, the excecutive lounge breakfast was not good  Best hotel experience ever. The hotel was gorgeous and when I checked in I got two bottles of water. The room they gave us was on the top floor with a balcony and it was huge. The bedding was super comfortable. Only non-perfect part was the breakfast, which was limited but nice.  ",wife,way,elevator,0.525
