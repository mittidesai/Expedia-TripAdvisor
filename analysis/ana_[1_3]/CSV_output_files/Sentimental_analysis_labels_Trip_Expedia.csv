0,8230,"     Fortune Hotel &amp; Suites, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9  SHOULD NOT BE LISTED The room was filthy.We requested a new room and it was worse.We found hairs on the pillows, in the bed,on the toilet and in the shower.Floors were filthy,blood on pillow cases, and to top it off vomit on the bathroom walls.We didn't stay because it was so disgusting.
Room Tip: Do not stay here.
See more room tips  Horrible, Terrible, the Worst ! The place is the pits. Not sure if this place should even be allowed to stay open. I feel really bad for the front desk staff. The staff had no help and when I asked to speak with a Manager it took 3 days and a guy named Peter was horrible. I am not sure if this manager could manage a paper bag !!!

The rooms are dirty and gross. Sheets and towels stained with holes in them. The housekeeping is horrible and when I asked for my room to be cleaned the poor cleaning lady said the manager Peter again doesn't buy them the supplies they need. I ended up going to Target and buying cleaning supplies to clean the room and gave them to the cleaning lady!

The owner should be ashamed to have a place run like this!
Room Tip: Ask for a room in another hotel ! If you have no choice make them put you in the first building. The...
See more room tips  Great value for money Reading other reviews I just don't know what some people expect. My wife and I paid $80 for 2 nights accom that included wifi, a basic breakfast, shuttle onto the strip and a venue that had a gym pool and jacuzzi. For that price this place was incredible. We were happy to end our night with a kilometre walk back from the strip. It's all flat and we just talked about the shows we had seen.  HOTEL MANGER These pictures aren't any representation of what the ""hotel"" actually is. 1990 TVs non HD. Broken latches in the rooms. Security cards don't even work.This is by far the worst hotel I've stood in and that says a lot. The Travelodge is a better buy than this crap.  Not so bad Didn't have any probs at the hotel, receptionist let me check in early without charge. Yes it's a ten minute walk to the strip but it's not that bad. So ignore the bad reviews and enjoy yourself. Free shuttle to airport is great. Free wifi the whole stay.  Imperial Cornation &amp; Meeting Thank you so Much to Judy &amp; Mark for helping me with this wonderful Event, from helping me book the rooms to letting me cook for my own event you guys are amazing, this hotel is about a mile from the strip, wonderful meeting rooms, wonderful staff we had a great and amazing time!!!!
we will be back
Mary  Photo trickery The first room I was assigned was tucked away under a case of stairs, blocking out any kind of natural light and smelt like it had been hot-boxed with cigarettes for the past 10 years (I am a smoker and it was unbearable). Next room was much better, but I felt the whole hotel had a smell of sour milk, and either those were clumps of dirt stuck in the ac or some kind of horrible herbal insense. The girl at the front desk did not smile once and had a very abrasive attitude and found her over-all attitude was as unwelcoming as the hotel felt.
There is also no bar or alcohol service in the hotel, so not even a chance to settle down and take a breather before you set out for the night.  Poor I did this hotel for 5 nights on a budget and whilst i wasn't expecting the most luxurious hotel in Las Vegas, i wasn't expecting it to be this poor.

My main criticisms are

- The $10 a night 'resort fee', as i didn't use any of it, and lets be honest, if your going to Vegas your not exactly going to be sat in this place for the duration
- The Breakfast was shockingly bad. I expected a better quality of breakfast and breakfast service. Not Polystyrene Cups, and plastic plates and cutlery. What was offered was extremely limited, the coffee was disgusting and i only used it once as i preferred to eat elsewhere
- My room was near the lift, which constantly beeped loudly 24/7, and it was annoying in the extreme when i was trying to get to sleep.
- No apparent security on the site, which meant anyone could gain access at any point during the day. Not ideal when i had valuables in my room.
- I didn't find the reception staff helpful at all, and if i needed anything then often providing customer service seemed like an hinderance.

Personally i would pay a little extra than stay here in the future.
Room Tip: Look elsewhere
See more room tips  Very bad experience I have chosen this hotel because of the free shuttle from / to the airport. I mentioned in my reservation I would arrive after 10h30 pm. I have called over 10 times and no one answered the phone after 10 pm, so I had to pay more for a taxi than for the hotel room.

Night reception was very bad, almost aggressive when I complained about the shuttle.

Rooms are old and ugly (although clean and good bed).

Breakfast is very poor. The worst coffee I have ever had in my life.

Finally, Peter, the manager, could only say he was sorry (and say that the van for the shuttle was stolen in their parking lot - Am I supposed to be sorry or feel insecure???)... so sorry that he turned his back and walked away while I was talking to him. The only nice person was a receptionist called Pahola.

He drove my husband and I to the airport in his personal car (not enough space in the trunk, child seat full of crumbs and children stuff in the floor). So I would NEVER recommend this hotel to a friend.  It's about value OK, so I was stuck in LV for the night having missed the last flt out. I was strictly shopping price on my IPad in the airport and for the sake of a 5 hour stay went with ""cheap"" &amp; close to airport. $26 a night got my attention as did the picture of the lobby staircase. The room was clean, AC was new and quiet, desk clerk friendly/polite. When I inquired about arranging for a cab back to the airport at 5 AM I was advd I could get a hotel provided shuttle...sweet. The driver was prompt and a pleasure to chat with. So this seasoned/well traveled airline retiree considered this brief stay the best deal I could have hoped for. I strongly urge the new owner to continue improving this dated property and justify increasing the room rate.    ",0.58,0.46,0.42,"""neg"""," Hotel was in a good location close to town, had a pretty good breakfast room with lots of choices, clean rooms & nice people. Coffee machine in room didn't work  - just noticed on last day. Very pleased.  Perfect location for being in Birmingham.  The hotel is quite average but the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. I thought the decor was very nice in its browns and blues and the windows were big and brought in lots of natural light. I watched a beautiful sunset the evening I arrived from my room.  The tub and shower area was very dark because the shower curtain blocked the light, as there was none in the shower itself. The supplied shampoo etc. was nice but came in stupid containers that were hard to get anything out of. One can walk right into Birmingham from the hotel; it's just a block from shopping and restaurants which is very nice.   The staff at the HIE Birmingham, MI are wonderful and poised to help with whatever problem or situation comes up.  I was helped several times a day with small or larger questions, such as ""my password doesn't work."" I got an immediate response and solution.   Nice, within proximity to Birmingham and Bloomfield and the shops and theater. Sits outside the hustle and bustle of the city area.  Trip was great and staff was very helpful with assistance as I was handicap from recent surgery.I enjoyed my stay.Did not like that the cleaning staff smoked in the storage room behind the elevator would be my only negative experience.  Very nice hotel. Friendly staff that was very helpful.  Would stay there again and close to Royal Oak Music theater.    We have stayed at the Holiday Inn in Birmingham before because of the location.  When I booked the room, the description listed the amenities.  One of the amenities was bathrobes and a queen size bed.  When we got to our room, I looked for the bathrobes but there weren't any.  I called the front desk to inquire about the bathrobes and the employee stated they don't have them.  Not that it's a big deal if we had bathrobes, but if the description states certain amenities then they should be provided.  The bed was listed as a queen size but looked more like a full.  We set the temperature in the room at 70.  When the fan came on, the room got extremely warm and when the fan turned off, the room got cold.  Lastly, I know there is a no smoking policy for the rooms, but around 7:15 in the morning, I could smell cigarette smoke coming from somewhere.  On a positive note, the room was clean, we enjoyed the Keurig coffee in the morning and the breakfast was good.  No problems to report, the facility was clean and comfortable, the staff was helpful and friendly.  Been staying in this building as different hotels since 2002 when I think it was a Raddison. It's just that the building itself has reached the end of it's life. The water pressure in the bathroom sink was essentially nonexistant; I ended-up just washing my hands using the bathtub filler which was fine. I called the desk about it, and they said they would look into it, but after 4 days nothing changed. The hotel has had a major front-desk re-do, along with new carpeting and stuff, but it's just not happening overall. The staff was mix of very helpful and very clueless; night and day, literally. The folks on during the day were fine and helpful, and the night not so much (the water-pressure shine-on). What Birmingham needs is a brand new Hampton Inn or similar, but I doubt there's any place to put it. Working on Detroit auto commercials, we used to stay at the Townsend without hesitation, or even this place back when it was the Raddison. But now that most economic factors are much lower than they were in the ""good old days"", ad budgets no longer afford the Townsend - and this place seems to have slipped a few more places in the last 4 years even with the re-do. It's location is unbeatable if you have business in Birmingham, except for the Townsend of course. It's just too bad that you leave hoping you won't need to come back. The TV service if still hovering around 1983 I'd say. All in all, if you're there just to take care of business and absolutely nothing else, it's fine.  The room was big and the bathroom nicely outfitted - marble and cushy towels. The pillows were comfortable and the beds were great. The breakfast is amazing. Great coffee, warm cinnamon rolls, nice omelets and fruit. Wow - really upscale for a HIE. You will love it.   Everything was great but our AC in the room did not work.  This hotel was the perfect choice for our trip. We needed to be close to Beaumont Hospital and it was only blocks away and easy to find.  It was close to resaurants, grocery store, Fed.Ex for mailing and copies, Starbucks - although the coffee provided by HIE was very good, and much more.  The beds were so very comfortable and the employees were all helpful and friendly and very professional.  The only drawback is the printer in the business center did not work very well, so we couldn't print our boarding passes.... better you make other arrangements.All around a great experience.    Nice and clean.  Easy to get too.  Staff was helpful and friendly.    Clean and quiet. OK breakfast with meal. By Chicago standards in walking distance to all of Birmingham amenities   The staff at this hotel were awesome, my only complaint would be that the heater was loud while we were sleeping.  The staff were pleasant. The breakfast was good. Parking was convenient with 6 to 8 covered parking spots. One negative would be that it took a while to get hot water in our shower, you had to run the water for a few minutes before it warmed. The small double bed should be replaced with queen or king size beds.  old and tied decore, Breakfast food horrible. don't have any further to say.  In town for a funeral so it was adequate. Room was clean and the beds were comfortable. Lobby area was quite small. Staff were pleasant.  This hotel is undergoing a facelift.  Our room was fully updated and beautiful.  There were some common areas awaiting updating.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The breakfast included more than the typical free continental breakfast.  Very nice stay..  room was clean, very large, bed was comfortable.  The bathroom was large, good shower.  VERY convenient to downtown Birmingham.  Nice that breakfast was included, too!  They are working on updating the hotel now too so it will, presumably, be even more updated in the near future.  My daughter and I spent 1 night here to attend Il Divo concert. Would return in the future.  very nice and friendly staff. i highly recommend if staying in the area.   I had my doubts at first, but then I came in everything was very nice and clean and organized. The hotel staff was very nice even made me laugh. Trust me I dont laugh much but they sure made me laugh. Asked for a few extra towels and they brought it up within two minutes. On the second day, I knew the hotel staff was going to clean up my room so i worried about my things. But when i got back. Everything was still there wish a very clean room. Thanks you very much.   The air conditioner in each room was absolutely filthy. The showers could have been cleaner. The elevator would jump either when you stepped on or got off. Mildly sketchy. Breakfast was ok... Other than that the rest of the property was fine. The bathroom was spacious.   I spent a week here for a job nearby and the hotel was good, rooms are clean, you get 4 pillows per bed (my room was double queen) i onky needed one bed, but it was a plus to have extra room to place clothes etc. The pillows are labeled firm and soft.  Nice touch! No more trying to figure what pillows I like.  I am giving feedback from clients that have traveled and stayed at your hotel.  They are there for corporate travel and are very happy.   Got in late and got to sleep late. Very quiet and breakfast went late  The room was neat and clean.  No frills, king bed, desk with chair and side chair.  Clean Bathroom.  View of the Waterpark across the street, it is off season so no crowds or traffic.  The staff was very friendly.  clean hotel, friendly staff. Close to few places to eat.  All good normal holiday inn staff helpful no problems   Asked for a fan several days before the stay. Fan was already in the room waiting. Asked for a complimentary additional hour before check out and it was not a problem.   Just stayed for night. Great front desk clerk. Nice breakfast. Great water park right across street.  This hotel was exactly what we were looking for-proximity to Dorney Park and clean and comfortable. Our whole family of five was impressed with the cleanliness of the room and the amenities. From the staff to the service, everything was great. This will be the place we choose again if we stay in the area.  I had a wonderful time. The peace and solitude I received during my stay at the hotel were unmatched.   We stayed 3 night at this hotel, very comfortable pillows, they offered coffee and tea around the clock and in August they had pancakes from 8-12 every night, all the staff were very nice, when we checked in Sunday evening one of our room keys didn't work the manager bought up a replacement key to us.  Stay was ok, been at better places, also been to worse   Good place to stay enjoyed the experience, clean,  new and well kept  Comp. breakfast and distance from Dorney Park.(across the street and walking distance). Good value for the price.  We arrived at the hotel a little early around 9:30 am. The receptionist was super nice to let us check in early so we can go to the park. She also offered us breakfast to save us time so my kids can go to Dorney Park when it opens. Room are clean, staffs are super nice & friendly, breakfast are delicious, location is very convenient. I give it 5 star overall. Would definitely recommend to others.  Nice hotel, we enjoyed our stay. Conveniently located right across the street from Doney Park.

1,8250,"     Skylofts at MGM Grand Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9  Rivals any suite or boutique hotel anywhere This is my fifth stay at the MGM SkyLofts. I have stayed in the best suites in LV and this is still my favorite. Celebreties agree as they frequent the SkyLofts as well. The Ghost Rolls Royce Limo Service, your own Butler, drinks stocked to your liking, a pillow menu, multi jet, steam shower, overflow bath, remote controlled room, cappucino maker, 5 different coffee beans and tea leaves, room service that is exquisite, access to the Mansion private restaurant (they will make you whatever you please), fooze ball tables, workout rooms, amazing turndown service, entire suite audio/video/light/climate controller........and so much more. If you have the means, stay here.
Room Tip: 1 bedroom skyloft, perfect for couples
See more room tips  Best stay ever in Vegas!!! The Skylofts were amazing! I am a snob when it comes to Vegas rooms and frequent the Penthouse suite at the Bellagio and have stayed in many hotel suites. This one was by far the best one yet! The Butler service was outstanding. I had many special requests and they graciously accommodated them all. My husband and I were there to get re-married for our 10 year anniversary and everyone at the Skylofts made it such a special trip. Had a great reception in the loft and the guests had a great time with our open bar, playing pool, nice sound system to play some loud music and the food. It was nice to have VIP access to clubs and reservations too! I cant wait to go back!  got to try this if your in Vegas late review

nothing like it !!!

You pay a fortune in a 5 star in London or NYC - this is nothing like any of that garbage!
Great rooms - pool tables/music everywhere/butler service/Limo

We had a view right down the strip

hope to be back someday!!  Fantastic Service We stayed at the SkyLofts a few times during business in Vegas. The check in could be faster but once you are in your ""loft"" it's smooth sailing.The personal butler is awesome-friendly and always helpful.The dining room was sexy and I wished we had a party there ! There was room ! The room service menu is great (and they are very accommodating to food allergies) The upstairs bedroom is FABULOUS ! You can control everything with one remote and that also means the light shades. It was DARK-AWWWWWW Sleepy sleep. The amazing spa shower &amp; tub are my personal faves .Can't wait to go back. The decor downstairs needs an upgrade -it's a bit worn and dated.  Let's Be Serious: ""IT IS THE BEST STAY IN VEGAS!"" We have stayed at the Skylofts many times, but just joined tripadvisor, so leaving a most recent review!
Reminds me of home, 29 stories in the sky! And the service is untouchable! You can literally go anywhere in Vegas and tell them your in the Skylofts, ...and you skip the line...no matter how long the waiting list, or how packed the nightclub, or anything! I have the Skylofts direct number programmed in my phone, and I usually just call them and say, ""Hello, I'm standing at such and such...can you call and tell them I'm here?"" Few minutes later, and we walk right in.
The staff, from the Skylofts private entrance, all the way to the top management, truly give you the celebrity experience!
This is by far our #1 choice EVERYTIME in Vegas!  Crazy !!!! Speechless !!!! Was In Vegas for a couple days in December quite a quite time .. But that don't mean nothing as we can make a party in gymnasium ... The loft it self, off the hook ! I have never experienced anything like it .... Where else picks you up from the airport in a Rolls Royce Phantom (big up the driver) walks you to you room like the star that I am lol and will run to Fat Burger or McDonalds if you are feeling peckish? Obviously this room comes at a premium but is worth every penny trust me. The butler is a special touch and the room sorry suite is out of this world !!!!! Kinda wrecked the suite when we were there but pop out for 30mins and it's ready to trash again ! Amazing loool

Ok seriously highly recommend with the boys plenty space to enjoy 10 out of 10

Down fall is once you've stayed here it's going to be very hard to stay anyplace else.

Hopefully going to book for 7 days for my stag week in June.

I suggest you give it a try.  Not bad When i stayed here the place was good and moderate when comparing to other areas!

Pricey but worth it. Be sure to dine at the Mansion if possible. Private experience,

air con worked fine, room was big, comfortable bed, not to noisy, my only gripe was the bathroom needed a new one badly, having said that the shower was very good  Great Spot Great Room Superior Service Highly recommended for Vegas getaway. Pricey but worth it. Be sure to dine at the Mansion if possible. Private experience, only for Skyloft guests. Live like a high roller. Dinner at L'Atelier Robuchon one of the very best anywhere.  O dear god... This place is awesome. I booked it for a buddy of mine for his Bachelor party. Let me say by saying the pictures really dont do justice for it....it's unbelievable. We had a two bedroom unit.

Starting out you get picked up by the rolls royce at LAS. From there, you go straight through the sky loft lobby and go striaght to your suite, where your butler is waiting, and the check in papers are waiting (we also had some awesome guava juice and fruit...we ended up buying pitchers of guava the entire weekend)....

Overall, just an awesome hotel. Will be staying here for all of my next vegas trips@!  Major improvement from my last visit Staff was very attentive, especially Mark - one of the butlers. Room was great, really like the ones in the 700 numbers. Everything that could go right, did. Fridge was stocked just the way I like it, pillows were perfect, the little bath tea bags were back and even breakfast was good.    ",0.46,0.52,0.54,pos,"   Stayed in Battle Creek for the night, needed a hotel that was reasonably priced, which this one was. Room was a good size. Inside beans looked dirty & the bathroom was a bit dated. No fan in the bathroom which makes no sense. The walls are paper thin, can hear people walking by like they are in your room. Housekeeping started on our floor at about 8am & knocked on our door twice before 9:30am, which was a little frustrating since we could hear them knock & yell for each room in our hallway. Very difficult to sleep through.   Good location between Chicago and East Lansing for MSU football games.  Hotel is being renovated.  Breakfast buffet was above average.  Older place, staff were great, breakfast was good and always stocked.  Everything was great except the bed it was stiff as a log but everything else was good.  The location is ideal, feet from the expressway entrance, shopping and all kinds of restaurants nearby. I was worried that my room was next to a noisy ice machine, but once the door was closed, the room was quiet. Since michigan has banned smoking rooms , I don't see why I was asked, not that politely, to initial a pledge. So I can't smoke in the room, ok. No need to be snarky.   It was very pleasant I loved the fact that they had breakfast in morning and that there were restaurants close by to hotel and gas stations too.it was a quiet atmosphere   The rooms are well equipped. More than enough power outlets. One of those fancy heat lamps in the bathrooms. Thinner and ticker pillows, so you can pick your preference. Nice warm pool.  Barking dogs across the hall. Sleeping was impossible. The staff was very helpful, but the owners of the dogs left them in the room by themselves. Only complaint I have!  The purpose of my trip was business.  I checked into the hotel around 4:00pm and then went to work.  I returned around midnight and my room key did not work.  The hotel clerk gave me another key to my room.  When I opened the door, I found another individual had been checked into my hotel room.  I informed the individual that my bag was in this room and I was informed that he found a bag in the room and brought it down to the front desk.  I returned to the front desk and informed the night clerk that someone else has been checked into my room and that my bag was apparently at the front desk.  He retrieved my bag from behind the counter and gave me another room.  As soon as I got to the room I determined that my bag had been rummaged through and I was missing several of my personal items.  I informed the hotel clerk immediately.  I immediately called Expedia and requested a refund, which I was given promptly.  I spoke with the day manager when she arrived in the morning and informed her what happened.  I was told she would speak with the general manager and he would be contacting me.  I had to contact him.  I asked him what is going to be done about compensating me for the articles I lost while my luggage was in their possession.  I was offered two nights free stay but informed him I will never be returning to their hotel.  I was then informed that the hotel is not responsible for lost or stolen property.  I am very disappointed in the service of this hotel.  Our room was very nice and I love lots of pillows and they had 4 on each bed, everything was clean and nice and the breakfast was super nice -way better than most hotel breakfasts the man who was over seeing it was very helpful the manager was super nice and very helpful we will stay again next time we go to Battle Creek for sure  Everything about this hotel was dated / old.  The lobby, hallways, rooms - all could use an  upgrade.I would not recommend to fellow travelers.   Easy check-in, pleasant and helpful staff, soft bed, very clean.  Staff was friendly. Breakfast was good. Waiter at buffet very kind!!  Feels tired and old. Bathtub was corroded. Really needs an update.  Hotel will shortly not be in Comfort family due to smallish size. Breakfast was terrible. Powdered eggs, biscuits & gravy - ugh - and watered down orange drink. The building plant was ok, but renovation is needed.  It appears the building had been renovated relatively recently....nice lobby, pool, breakfast area, etc. However, second floor hallway indicated that the renovations stopped short at the first floor. The mirrored closet door in our room was off the pivots and just leaning against the wall. The room still had the odor of smoking, even tho' there is a no smoking policy in force.  The hotel was clean but showing its age.  We had a comfortable bed,nice room.  It was not easy to get to coming off the interstate   Was in town for business at the same time of the NJCAA Regional Baseball Tournament. The desk staff let me know that 3 teams were staying at the hotel, but made special effort to place me in as quiet a corner of the hotel as possible.The room was clean and very comfortable...  I called the night before and asked about rates. I asked about Expedia and if I had to go through them to get their prices. The staff member said yes, later to find out No you do not have to. They actually recommend you go through the hotel. When checking in, we where walking to our room and all you could do is smell smoke! Come to find out they are remodeling and the workers were leaving the door open.  They switched us to a new room. I went to call down and the phone wasn't working. Took them til the next day to fix! Only to find out its broke. Wanted to move us to a different room, no upgrade! Breakfast was horrible. Only had 2 eggs in fridge. Waited over 30 mins, still know breakfast! Guests smoking right outside of lobby. What bothers me is you have to sign a smoking waiver! No smoking within 25 feet of hotel or there is a fine! The one hotel staff member kept telling us inaccorute information!   The Staff was friendly, and accommodating. Although the hotel was under construction; our room was clean, and met all of our needs.My only complaint is that the beds were totally different. One was ""hard as a rock""; the other was softer and more comfortable. The pillows were Great!!!!!

2,8253,"     Artisan Hotel, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9  Clean But Loud The hotel was okay. It was clean, but the air conditioning didn't work properly in our room. Additionally, we were right above a very poorly insulated night club that was hosting latin dance night for about 3 people. I wish I had known this at the time of booking as there was no option for a room in a different part of the hotel. The girl at the desk was snobbish when we asked if they had any rooms away from the club and asked if we would rather check in somewhere else. Thank goodness we were only there for a night.
Room Tip: Ask to be away from the night club.
See more room tips  Great party weekend!!! If you approach this hotel with realistic expectations then you can't go wrong. We really weren't there to sleep. We began with an awesome day at the couples themed pool party. Evolve. If you have visited other Vegas pools you know how hard it can be to get service. Ben and Tommy provided superior service with and outstanding attitude. As well, the crowd itself was super friendly and fun. We didn't get to try any of the night time events due to a concert (NIN) but when we returned to the hotel just after 2am people were still arriving and the place was hoppin. We stayed in room 503 and were very pleased with it. The decor and lighting at this property is dark so my wife did have a lighting problem when it came to getting ready and make-up. There is a lot of outside noise from either the nearby highway or late night parties so be forewarned that sleep may be a little hard..... We expected this per the reviews and like I said, we were here to enjoy the Vegas experience. We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and our experience with the staff was great.  Mellow summer mid-week stay If you have an odd numbered room on floor 4 or 5 you will have a nice view of the strip. We liked seeing the warehouse district in the foreground and the strip lit up in the background.

Due to the restaurant being closed off and the summer heat the place was empty. The decor is rad. The bar and pool were empty it was easy to score a cabana and chill out. Not much staff around - sort of annoying you have to go to the bar to get ice. The price was amazing $27 and a free bottle of twist top champagne - hilarious and just another $15 for a 3pm check-out.

The rooms are sexy and fun - we would definitely come back.
Room Tip: 5th floor odd numbered
See more room tips  For the hyp and price I expected better. When we arrived we were only greeted by one staff member. It was under construction so the lobby and half of our floor was taped off. The receptionist checking us in wasnt so nice or helpful. No one helped with our bags. When we got to our room, there was a funny smell. The room was tiny compared to what I was expecting for that price or even from the pictures. The toilet paper holder was broken, and they geniusly put the garbage can under it, so when the toilet paper fell, it went into the garbage instead of the floor. We went to the bar and the bartenders looked over us at least twice, then were rude. Music was so loud you couldn't hear a thing. It was very dark at all times. Party lasted long after 7am. Pool had white stuff floating on top and leaves and pines. It was an OK stay but was disappointing in the end.  Trip with friends We rode the MegaBus from Riverside, CA as an adventure trip and chose the Artisan from it website because it looked interesting. I will start with the good features. This is an interesting hotel off the strip. It is an adult only hotel, which was nice. There are works of art on all the walls and ceilings and in the rooms. The hotel is 5 floors. There is a bar and restaurant on site. The rooms are clean and a nice size but the whole place is in dark wood and very dark inside. They have a pool and it is topless (optional) and there were topless women in the pool during our stay. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It was nice just going around looking at all the art. A lot of the art is styled after the Master's of the 17th Century, a lot of nude works of art but very tasteful. The have an adults only channel that comes with the price of the room. Now for the down side. The hotel is right next to the 15 Interstate Highway and the traffic was very loud all night long. The hotel is not well insulated. The restaurant was closed due to a construction accident but it was not stated on the website. The hotel is not within walking distance of anyplace to eat. It is about 1.2 miles from the strip and not easy to get to a bus stop because of the highway and the very busy Sahara Blvd. (The bus system is a Plus) There is a bus stop in front of Palace Station. The bus system is very good in Vegas and it will save you a lot of head aches if you are trying to drive around Vegas and Taxis are not inexpensive in Vegas. The bus system offers a 2 hour pass for $6.00, a 24 hour pass for $8.00 and a 3 day pass for $20.00. The pass is good for any bus in Vegas so you can pretty much go anywhere. That is a plus. The prices for drinks were very high, especially since they are so far from everything else. On Wed, Fri and Sat nights they have music in the bar (DJ) from 10 pm until 4 pm, but the music was so loud we could not stay in the bar. We could not hear the music from our room but our friends who where on the 4th floor stated it was hard to sleep because of the booming bass sounds from the bar. This is probably not a place we would stay again because of the location but it was a fun hotel and it if was not as noisy and more accessible to other places it would be a great place.
Room Tip: If you like loud music, partying and adult themes this is a fun place to give a try.
See more room tips  Party Time and Quality Service Definitely a unique place to stay if you are tired of cookie cutter hotels. Art all over and a very seductive vibe. The whole staff was super courteous and the Management Tara treated us like a close friend she had known for years. Would visit here again to party!  Always a great time at the Artisan Hotel We are a married couple who's youngest child celebrated his 21st birthday in Artisan's best suite a year and a half ago. Who says that you have to be close to 21 years old to enjoy the after hours scene. We love this place and most of the staff. We have always received EXCEPTIONAL service from every aspect of service except for the house keeping staff. Every time we stay longer than 4 days here it seems that whomever is assigned to service our room will ignore the ""Do not disturb"" sign and wake us up REAPEATEDLY. The only maid who has been assigned to our room but has still provided exceptional service is their youngest housekeeper. We don't know her name but she is a short dark haired Latina who always has a smile on her face.

We love the laid back staff and party atmosphere.  GORGEOUS ENTRY, STUNNING LOBBY, MUSIC NEVER ENDS We couldn't wait to book this hotel and we knew it would be different, all the different reviews made it difficult to choose this hotel and off strip always makes it more confusing. Well this is the best review I will give on Trip Advisor so others have an idea of what to expect.

We arrived to a beautiful valet entry of the Artisan Hotel and was amazed of the vegetation, the trees, the whole entry is remarkable. Valet is 4 stars!! very nice, polite and made you feel welcomed every time we returned back from the day.

Entering the lobby it was dark, cozy and has a sexy aura about it. Check in was simple and organized, the male who checked us in was very good but however the front desk clerks beyond that, definately don't make you feel interested in answering any questions you may have about the property or surrounding area and every question seemed to have a undesirable response. I have stayed at Marriotts before with 5 stars customer service, I wasn't expecting that but even the waffle house has an immediate hello and thank you for coming which MAKES customer service your first feeling of how the service will be. So needless to say 2 stars for the front desk.

The room was awesome, seemed to be remodeled, great amenities, awesome view of strip and tiny view of pool but the room was great!! 4 stars for that (Porno station reruns same movie all wknd, c'mon guys).

Now to the lounge/nightclub. Simple, great decor, great patio and interesting. Great place to be with someone or meet someone because it could be real romantic and cozy!!, but the music is sooo damn loud you cannot hear each other and its not geared towards the middle age crowd.The bartenders were really not welcoming and actually seemed annoyed when we tried to spark a conversation or have questions about the property. So 2 stars for that staff.

The Pool is simple, nice and can be relaxing if they played soft top 40's or 70-80's music but the Techno, Thump Thump music at 8am is absolutely REDICULOUS. You party all night whether at the hotel or on the strip and get home at 4 am and I could sleep through the crazy after hours lounge music but when it goes from there to the pool at 8 am everyday!!, music so loud that from the fifth floor I thought the room next door was having a party. It was disgraceful and I have read the reviews on the music and thought I could sleep through it. NEGATIVE. Sunday morning it started up and about an hr later it shut off, It was the best morning I had and that means sleeping!!

The perfect Artisan would be the party stops at 4a.m and the pool music turns on at 11 am, descent pool music not the pounding speaker driven techno music and conversation around the pool would increase and probably also the traffic by more couples. I am probably missing something but I did give it 3 stars!! the property is beautiful, the housekeepers and valet were perfect and made you feel at home, but as my fiancee said,,""I will not come back here because staying out all night we need sleep in the morning and this party music at 8 am doesn't allow us to recoup for the next night out. I understand they only have 3 floors of occupancy so the bar after hours club probably generates a whole lot of money which we both understood, but the hotel environment should not be ruined by the continuous thumping techno around the clock base music. The general manager was very polite and courteous, but its all about the bottom line and in vegas you have to find your niche, but the guest will always return, the young kids partying will always move on.
Room Tip: 5th floor facing strip is beautiful, beware music by after hrs bangs all night and music by pool run...
See more room tips  RE: Pool Closed to SINGLE MALES I still think VERY HIGHLY of this Hotel. Being someone on low salary, I thought this hotel really cares for it guests until I was told I could not use the pool. Be very careful to confirm what you can use in the hotel. I think the pool is one of the coolest in Vegas, but I can't go there.  Beautiful Fun Hotel! My husband and I stayed at the Artisan for a few days in April. It was our 1st anniversary and we wanted something fun and special. We were not disappointed! The lobby of the hotel was breathtaking, the service was fantastic and our room was clean.
Room Tip: We stayed on the 5th floor (room 525). From this room I could not hear the fantastic dance party dow...
See more room tips    ",0.6,0.88,0.4,"""neutral""","Pet friendly - upon arrival room smelled strongly from dog poop.  Had to change.  Breakfast is included but poor quality.Not the best experience...Stay elsewhere.    very centrally located clean staff friendly and helpful  The receptionist was courteous and knowledgeable, the rooms was clean and comfortable.  A good light breakfast was offered in the morning .   The experience was good with a courteous receptionist clean comfortable room and nice breakfast.   Location was great for shopping and restaurants, all within walking distance. Clean and quite. Breakfast buffet was good, but lady working it was not very helpful with guest. The eggs and sausage were served from a different side window and not the buffet table so many like us did not even notice until one guest asked the lady and then lots of people got up and went for eggs. When she served the eggs she just gave everyone eggs and sausage even if they asked for eggs, no smiles no talk I wouldn't say rude , but she just didn't have customer service attitude. Oh and she didn't keep the fruit stocked up. No bananas left despite the fact I could see a box of fruit in the room where she served out of. Otherwise everything else was great.  No issues with stay. I would stay again, should I return.  We hate that place even if at the desk they consent to change our room after  some arguments.  Had a non-smoking room but evidently someone had smoked in it. Had to leave the door open some.   We had a lovely stay in Yarmouth....too brief though!!  Hotel was nice and clean, breakfast not that great and also no pool in the hotel.  Easy access easy parkingGreat accommodating staffNice breakfast each day   Stayed only one night. Breakfast was excellent. Very filling.   We enjoyed our stay in Yarmouth. Hotel is centrally located and was very comfortable.  My boyfriend, myself and my small dog stayed for 3 nights during Nova Scotia music week and were pretty disappointed unfortunately. The first night was great, everything was clean and comfortable. The staff didn't seem to be too friendly at first but throughout the trip they seemed to get better. One of the days I was leaving the room, housekeeping asked if I wanted service. I said yes. I said I wanted the full service and specifically asked for my sheets to be changed. When I got back, the room was okay however the sheets were not changed. The one thing I specifically asked for. They also left cleaning supplies in the bathroom. For the last night, I left my dog in the room while my boyfriend and I went out to enjoy some of the music. Unfortunately the room next to ours was having some kind of a party and it was scaring my dog. When I arrived I gave the hotel my phone number incase anything like that happened so they can call me and I could come tend to her.  They did call, and left a very rude message. ""Come care for your dog, we don't want to have to charge another guests room to your bill due to the disturbance."" The tone, the threat, all of it was unacceptable. I work at a full service hotel myself and know how these situations are supposed to be handled. I immediately came back to the hotel and calmed the situation. I was shocked that I was called about my dog, however the room beside us was still partying by the time we got back. I won't be back.   Breakfast wasn't great but overall a good experience.   Very quick and polite check in. Room very comfortable clean and quiet.  Hotel check-in staff were perfunctory at best, I was left to find my own way to the room through the oddly located (and unsigned) stairwell. The hotel is on the main drag on the way into Yarmouth and despite being surrounded by places, there is basically no pedestrian infrastructure so be prepared to trek across car parks, jaywalk across 3 lanes of traffic, or get back in your car. The breakfast was limited at best, not recommended. Worryingly, the hotel has a sharps policy (for things like syringes(!)) and a no-shirt-no-shoes-no-service policy, which perhaps tells you something of the pitch. The room was clean and the shower decent.  This hotel was in a very convenient location for our family event. Very adequate breakfast and super comfortable bed and pillows (my pet peeve!)   The hotel accommodations were very good. the hotle was only 5 minutes from the ferry terminal. The distance was very convenient for us.IMPORTANT: When I called the hotel directly last Thursday, Aug 27th, I was checking on ""late arrival"" status. They had no reservation for us. When I booked this hotel thru Expedia a month ago, your people or system computers never sent an electronic confirmation to the hotel's computer. Fortunately, they still had a room left for us to book. I called Expedia and they rebooked the reservation for us, since your company goofed big-time. I  won't be booking with Expedia in the future for hotels or flights.Goodbye  Very friendly staff, close to downtown and lots of restaurants and stores within walking distance.  We will definetly go back.  Staff is very nice.  Hotel is dated and musty.  Pet friendly - upon arrival room smelled strongly from dog poop.  Had to change.  Breakfast is included but poor quality.Not the best experience...Stay elsewhere.    very centrally located clean staff friendly and helpful  The receptionist was courteous and knowledgeable, the rooms was clean and comfortable.  A good light breakfast was offered in the morning .   The experience was good with a courteous receptionist clean comfortable room and nice breakfast.   Location was great for shopping and restaurants, all within walking distance. Clean and quite. Breakfast buffet was good, but lady working it was not very helpful with guest. The eggs and sausage were served from a different side window and not the buffet table so many like us did not even notice until one guest asked the lady and then lots of people got up and went for eggs. When she served the eggs she just gave everyone eggs and sausage even if they asked for eggs, no smiles no talk I wouldn't say rude , but she just didn't have customer service attitude. Oh and she didn't keep the fruit stocked up. No bananas left despite the fact I could see a box of fruit in the room where she served out of. Otherwise everything else was great.  No issues with stay. I would stay again, should I return.  We hate that place even if at the desk they consent to change our room after  some arguments.  Had a non-smoking room but evidently someone had smoked in it. Had to leave the door open some.   We had a lovely stay in Yarmouth....too brief though!!  Hotel was nice and clean, breakfast not that great and also no pool in the hotel.  Easy access easy parkingGreat accommodating staffNice breakfast each day   Stayed only one night. Breakfast was excellent. Very filling.   We enjoyed our stay in Yarmouth. Hotel is centrally located and was very comfortable.  My boyfriend, myself and my small dog stayed for 3 nights during Nova Scotia music week and were pretty disappointed unfortunately. The first night was great, everything was clean and comfortable.

3,8267,"     Hampton Inn Las Vegas/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 9  Short stay The Queen beds were too soft for my back, not the hotels fault they ran out of the King beds by the time I booked. The breakfast was very good as usual, and the staff was great. The gym was workable. The rooms were spotless everyday I returned. This was the first time I did not get complmentary bottled water.  Bad Hampton This is an atypical Hampton experience for me. I would avoid this location. The hotel is dated, the rooms are marginal with a lot of street/HWY noise . If you have a profile good luck 1 didn't seem to matter that I have Gold Status . Make sure you know where Star Bucks is located, if you drink coffee . The breakfast kitchen staff didn't seem to know when the coffee pots were or that they were empty.  First Time at a Hampton I have stayed at a lot of Hilton properties and this was the first time I have stayed at a Hampton Inn and I was pleasantly surprised. Good sized rooms, free internet for Hhonors members if you book on Hilton.com and a reasonable breakfast is included.

There's a great brew pub restaurant across the road a Whole Foods down the road and a Target a block or so away. Also it's near a large hospital and countless doctor's offices.

The only downside - it's very close to the freeway and the noise can be a little intrusive but I would stay here again but ask for a room on the front side of the hotel.
Room Tip: Ask for a room at the front of the hotel away from the freeway
See more room tips  A very nice and quiet experience This hotel offers a very good total experience. It features: Easy Parking, efficient check-in, clean rooms, great breakfast with extended hours. And the staff is very friendly and attentive. If you desire that use of a pool, hot tub, or work out gym these are all convenient to access as well. Overall... I'll be back  Clean and Fresh I stayed here when I had to be at an event close by early the next morning in the northwest end of Las Vegas. It is a distance from the strip which is good and bad depending on the purpose of your stay. From the rooms to the breakfast buffet, my colleague and I both commented on how clean this hotel is. The front desk staff was friendly upon check in and recommended to us the Aces and Ales restaurant as somewhere to go within walking distance. The breakfast buffet was fabulous, and the stay in general was great. I even took a bath because the room was that clean. My only downfall was the TV in my room did not work and I reported it. They were going to immediately send someone up but I was in bed so told them to fix it the next day.  A Little Disappointed Love, love Hampton Inns but this hotel was a disappointment. The positives = excellent front desk staff, housekeepers and breakfast staff, all great. The room was very clean. Breakfast was usual Hampton offering and was very good. Coffee in lobby was fabulous, always there &amp; fresh &amp; hot. So why the 3 average rating? The bed was not comfortable at all. Mattress was very thin &amp; hard, no pillowtop/cushioning of any kind. Didn't sleep well for 2 nights there.  Quiet and friendly hotel Location is off the strip. Quiet and nice hotel. Friendly and helpful staff. Pool was not heated and the water was very cold. Only room available was a smoking room. Even though the room was clean it smelled like smoke which was unpleasant. I would stay here again but only if a non-smoking room was available.  Golf Stay Very nice hotel, desk clerk Jo Jo made us feel welcome and offered good advice on the hotel area and restaurant recommendations. Great complimentary breakfast, Wi Fi connection is only so so, could receive E mails but sending was problematic. Could hear upstairs guest through ceiling.  Outside strip It is a hotel outside strip without a casino. Very nice and quiet. Big and clean rooms. Very nice breakfast buffet. It has a shuttle both to airport and strip. It takes 20 minutes walking to strip. The staff are very helpful.  friendly hotel the staff are wonderful and greet me by name every evening, the rooms are clean, everything is bright, internet is great; delicous complimentary breakfast; complimentary cookies to make every evening great!

Great view, nice balcony with table and chairs. Free bus rides up and down the main street to visit different locations - restaurants, beaches, stores...  This is not a hotel. The units are owned and maintained by various owners. The first unit we were in the comforter and shams were worn, stained and appeared dirty. The toilet moved. The second room was clean and well maintained. Towel exchange and garbage removal are the guest's responsibilities. There is no phone in the room and the office closes at 5 pm M-S and 1 pm on Sundays. The pool is clean and the beach is close. A heron guarded the pool and walked around the edge snacking on water bugs. Beach chairs, umbrellas, and floats are plentiful and available for guests. The staff is very friendly and accommodating.   The studio was well furnished, kitchen had all you need. The overall place is not pristine, but the location makes up for it. We stayed in studio 119. The only problem with it was the beds, both the kings size bed and the pull out bed were lumpy and hard. The sheets for the pull out bed and the pillow were not fresh. But everything else was really nice about this studio, wish they would just improve the beds. The hotel is close to the free trolley stops, and the hotel had parking. We actually did not use to use the car to get around.  I can't rate Club Bamboo as a hotel, as it does not have daily cleaning, restaurant or other hotel amenities. It's older but nicely updated condo rentals in a c.14 unit building; King studios with kitchen/dishes/pots & pans/micro, 2 burner electric cooktop/coffee maker/toaster, small pullout sofa and ottoman, table and chairs. All basically the same with some differences by condo unit owners. Towels and bed linens are supplied, and some could be newer. One roll of paper towels and one roll of TP; two trash bags per two trash cans, then you buy your own or request more from the office. All rooms have great gulf and beach views. There was always hot water and good water pressure. There's a small heated pool, plenty of chairs, tables, picnic tables, barbecues, and it's right on the beach.I loved my room, and would stay at Club Bamboo on beautiful Anna Maria Island again.  Excellent view from the balcony. The heated pool was great when the ocean water was too cold for swimming.   Everything  was acceptable.  Bed was Very uncomfortable.    Pleasant stay. Big room, very spacious, newer kitchen. Balcony was very large. Gorgeous view of the Gulf of Mexico. Front desk person was very personable.Only complaints would be that the tile floor was not mopped very well and housekeeping fee, which I felt was excessive for what little work we left for housekeeping to do (especially since the floor was filthy already). Perhaps the fee should be based upon the occupants of the room and not to each and every one. We left only the change of bedding and towels for housekeeping to do, normal room turnover maintenance.Despite that, we would definitely return to this hotel.  Great hotel, staff a bit green, but friendly. The elevator was a bit dodgy, but all told, great experience! Would stay again for sure!  The rooms are awesome great view of the beach, awesome pool not to big but great, they had extra chair to take to the beach to see the sun set, not to far to shoping and restaurants. I would stay there again, friendly staff  My husband and I really enjoyed staying at Club Bamboo.  We have stayed on Anna Maria multiple times but this was our first time staying on the beach.  We had a second floor room and the views from the balcony were priceless.  The balcony is a nice size too with a table and four chairs.  Cindy in the office was very friendly and answered all of our questions with a smile.  We would definitely stay at Club Bamboo again!  Very nice rooms, great beach area & sunset views, nice pool area....met some really nice people staying there. Will definitely go back again. Nice management too.  Office hours listed in all of the published materials are not accurate, nor are the hours listed on their voice mail. When we arrived (4:50 p.m. Sunday), the office was already closed. We were left an envelope. The keys did not work. Left a voice mail, no contact. Went back to main office, called cell phone listed on door. Response was quick and new keys were issued. They charge $18/day if you want your room cleaned, including fresh towels. Office didn't open before 10:00 and it's questionable when it did open. We had to walk to the main office to turn in dirty towels and get clean ones. Trash was not emptied without paying the $18.00/day. TV remote control didn't work...again, had to wait until someone was in the office. No telephones in the rooms. Carpet dirty. Bathroom had bad smells. Parking is a little difficult. Would not stay at Club Bamboo again.  spent the week with my 4 yr old daughter and loved the stay. absolutely beautiful  This was a very nice hotel. The staff did a good job of cleaning and keeping things neat. Room needed better ventillation as the air conditioner was not strong enough to keep the humidity at a decent level.Overall for the price and the location, I would definately visit again!  We were expecting clean, comfortable accomodations for a family of 3 and that's exactly what we got. We were very pleased. (Although, we did have to stack up the two fold out mattresses to make the fold out bed comfortable for a 13 yr old). Great balcony view of a beautiful, walkable, pristine beach. We wanted a very laid back, quiet, beach trip, and this is the perfect location for that. Due to cool weather, we didn't use the pool, but it looked very nice and clean. We chose this location as a base for day trips to Anna Maria one day, and then to Sanibel another day. It's not luxurious, but again, we weren't expecting that. I'd definitley visit again for a nice, economical place to stay.  If you like a relaxing place where you have a Balcony over looking the Gulf of Mexico, Dolphins swimming by, Birds of all kinds, this place has EVERYTHING. The room had a FULLY Equipped Kitchen. We never left our room except to go to the beach. Very helpful staff at the desk as well. Ask about Island Gourment as well. The Best food delivered right to the room.  I wanted to say I was so happy with this Resort my family and I had the greatest time. I will be returning.  This is a very nice place.....clean and well maintained. We really enjoyed our stay here.  Very nice kitchenette with up to date appliances, granite countertop and stools. Smartly painted room that is well furnished. I really liked the upgrade flat screen tv and I thoroughly enjoyed the spacious beach view balcony and the great outdoor pool, as well. I was very impressed with the accomadations and would most definitely return again for another relaxing beach experience.    could not rest on this softer mattresstold it was new but please spend a few more bucks on a firm onelinens on bed were very old and thinbeautiful ocean view and parking lacking space  we had no parking in the evening after 6pm  Loved the room!

I would stay there again, friendly staff  My husband and I really enjoyed staying at Club Bamboo.  We have stayed on Anna Maria multiple times but this was our first time staying on the beach.  We had a second floor room and the views from the balcony were priceless.  The balcony is a nice size too with a table and four chairs.  Cindy in the office was very friendly and answered all of our questions with a smile.  We would definitely stay at Club Bamboo again!  Very nice rooms, great beach area & sunset views, nice pool area....met some really nice people staying there. Will definitely go back again. Nice management too.  Office hours listed in all of the published materials are not accurate, nor are the hours listed on their voice mail. When we arrived (4:50 p.m. Sunday), the office was already closed. We were left an envelope. The keys did not work. Left a voice mail, no contact. Went back to main office, called cell phone listed on door. Response was quick and new keys were issued. They charge $18/day if you want your room cleaned, including fresh towels. Office didn't open before 10:00 and it's questionable when it did open. We had to walk to the main office to turn in dirty towels and get clean ones. Trash was not emptied without paying the $18.00/day. TV remote control didn't work...again, had to wait until someone was in the office. No telephones in the rooms. Carpet dirty. Bathroom had bad smells. Parking is a little difficult. Would not stay at Club Bamboo again.  spent the week with my 4 yr old daughter and loved the stay. absolutely beautiful  This was a very nice hotel. The staff did a good job of cleaning and keeping things neat. Room needed better ventillation as the air conditioner was not strong enough to keep the humidity at a decent level.Overall for the price and the location, I would definately visit again!  We were expecting clean, comfortable accomodations for a family of 3 and that's exactly what we got. We were very pleased. (Although, we did have to stack up the two fold out mattresses to make the fold out bed comfortable for a 13 yr old). Great balcony view of a beautiful, walkable, pristine beach. We wanted a very laid back, quiet, beach trip, and this is the perfect location for that. Due to cool weather, we didn't use the pool, but it looked very nice and clean. We chose this location as a base for day trips to Anna Maria one day, and then to Sanibel another day. It's not luxurious, but again, we weren't expecting that. I'd definitley visit again for a nice, economical place to stay.  If you like a relaxing place where you have a Balcony over looking the Gulf of Mexico, Dolphins swimming by, Birds of all kinds, this place has EVERYTHING. The room had a FULLY Equipped Kitchen. We never left our room except to go to the beach. Very helpful staff at the desk as well. Ask about Island Gourment as well. The Best food delivered right to the room.  I wanted to say I was so happy with this Resort my family and I had the greatest time. I will be returning.  This is a very nice place.....clean and well maintained. We really enjoyed our stay here.  Very nice kitchenette with up to date appliances, granite countertop and stools. Smartly painted room that is well furnished. I really liked the upgrade flat screen tv and I thoroughly enjoyed the spacious beach view balcony and the great outdoor pool, as well. I was very impressed with the accomadations and would most definitely return again for another relaxing beach experience. ",0.67,0.75,0.33,"""neutral"""
4,8268,"     Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center Hotel Reviews Page 9  below expectations I've stayed at other Residence Inns and had better experiences. Compared to other similar hotels (to include other Residence Inns), the rooms are very small, and I felt clausterphobic. The breakfast area was ok and well stocked, but the general feel of the hotel was depressing. Maybe it's because of the location in Vegas, but as a regular business traveler, I hope I don't have to stay there again. Location was ok for me as I had business in the Wells Fargo building. Their are chain resturuants within walking distance. It's a long walk to the Strip, or a short cab ride. There's usually one or two cabs waiting out front; otherwise, I found one passed by every so often.  Handy Location This hotel is close to the airport, although they do not offer a hotel van for guests. Not a problem, a taxi was only about $15 which included a tip. ... The room was comfortable and clean. The WiFi worked well and there was a good breakfast which started early. The front desk staff were friendly and welcoming. We were satisfied with our stay and would recommend it to others. (If driving, take the Flamingo Exit off I-15 and go east.)
Room Tip: The bell on the elevator is set too loud. I would recommend not staying too close to the lifts.

Green Features: As with other Marriott properties, they seem to be in step with current environment steps to conserve.  Great Experience! Stayed at this hotel for 2 days on Labor Day weekend. Location was great, away from the hustle bustle of the strip but not that far, about 10 min drive. It was surrounded by nice restaurants: Fogo de Chao, Gordon Birsch, McCormick, Lawrys. Staff was friendly, room is clean, building is well-maintained. Breakfast buffet was great as well and dining area was spacious but still tends to get packed during peak hours so you should plan to come early as they suggest. Check-in time was 4pm but we came around 3pm and were allowed to check-in. We were so tired from traveling for more than 4 hours from Los Angeles so we appreciated that so much. Overall experience was really great and will surely come back.  A Mile from the Strip-Calm and Caring Service Tonight is my first night at the Residence Inn Las Vegas Hughes Center. The front desk staff welcomes you warmly. The rooms are in excellent condition. Breakfast is available in the morning. I walked to the Strip and back in the evening and felt pretty safe, but I would suggest taking a taxi in the evening for added security. I LOVE walking. If you enjoy a good walk or a pool and jacuzzi to take in the rays, enjoy this peaceful hotel with the extra space that the Marriott Residence brand provides. I would bring my family for leisure.
P.S. The Hard Rock, McCormicks and Schmicks, Landry and many other hotels are just a minute walk.
Room Tip: I stayed on the fifth floor and there was hardly any outdoor noise.
See more room tips  Excellent Hotel Just stayed at the Residence Inn Hughes Center in Las Vegas and had a great experience. The place is clean, well run, great service,and has all the amenities of Residence Inn (full kitchen, breakfast every morning, gym, etc.) Highly recommended.  Good one night option coming to and from the airport We got in late to Vegas and wanted a place to stay away from the strip before leaving the next morning for Zion. On the way back from ZNP, we needed a place for a one night stay again before leaving the next morning to return home. This hotel had a very friendly and easy check-in. Free parking was in a garage right behind the hotel with easy access to the elevators.

The rooms were comfortable and clean and the breakfast in the morning was well stocked with several employees working hard to clear tables and keep everything stocked. There are several restaurants within walking distance. We ate at Gordon Biersch and enjoyed our meal and drinks. It was a Monday evening and there was a manager meal of chicken we opted to not eat but it looked like lots of guests were enjoying it.

The hotel is close to a Starbucks for a morning coffee, a gas station to refill the rental car before heading to the airport, and a Fed Ex in case you did too much shopping.

The hotel is ~15 minutes from the airport. We would definitely stay here again if in Vegas again.
Room Tip: There are office buildings close by so pick a higher level to avoid hearing traffic
See more room tips  Good for non smokers Most of the casino hotels reek of smoking but this isn't a casino so doesn't have this problem. Rooms are large well equipped and comfortable. Pool is a bit basic but car park is good. There are good places nearby to eat and the free breakfast is good. Staff were friendly and efficient.
Disadvantage is that it's a bit far from the strip but there are buses and taxis.
Room Tip: Better views up high. Fairly quiet area.

Green Features: Not sure about these but seems a sensible hotel. They did not make a feature of this.  Worked well for our short stay We were in Vegas for 8 nights - 7 at the Grand Chateau and needed a place for extra night before flying home on Saturday. We had a free Marriott night so chose the Residence Inn which was perfect for our last night in town. Its off the strip but close to restaurants. Breakfast was crowded but well stocked and we were there early so didnt have to wait in much line. Always like having kitchenette and we did enjoy the pool in the afternoon. I would recommend this hotel for the price and if you want to be off the strip but close to UNLV.  Decent hotel. Bad internet, small gym/pool, public laundry. My overall stay at the hotel was not a bad experience. Everyone was friendly and helpful. There is breakfast every morning and dinner on Mondays/Tuesdays/every other Wednesday. There is a small shop where you can pick up wine, beer, snack food, soda, tea, and microwaveable items. The room is fairly cozy. It had a couch, chair, desk, office chair, two bar stools, small counter top bar, small kitchen, large fridge, decent closet space, single dresser, two nightstands, large bathroom mirror, and a small full bathroom separate from the bathroom sink.

There are some drawbacks to this hotel though through the amenities. The rooms do not have washers/dryers like in other extended stay hotels. You are forced to pay $3 to wash and dry your clothes in a central wash room on 3 of the floors, each containing 2 washers/dryers. The internet is free, unless you pay to upgrade the bandwidth. The drawback to the internet is that the service provider/equipment that the hotel has is horrible. Even if you pay to have the faster internet, you still have tons of packet loss and high latency, even during non-peak hours. If you are a gamer, avoid the thought of even playing while here. It is probably at the top of my list for worst hotel internet connection. I notified the business and was given a code to use to try and remedy the issues with the connection (as I need the internet for work) and the issues were not resolved. If you are athletic and like to workout, the gym has a few cardio machines and free weights. The gym is absolutely lacking. The pool is small and usually full of kids. There is a decent hot tub.

TL;DR:
-Good service
-Decent room
-Free breakfast everyday
-Free dinner Mondays/Tuesday/every other Wednesday
-Off the strip, but close enough to everything
-Horrible free/paid internet
-Public laundry
-Small pool
-Hot tub
-Tiny gym
Room Tip: A room facing towards the strip has its perks. View of the strip and the pool.
See more room tips  Great hotel off the Strip We stayed at this hotel for one night and moved to the Mirage for three nights. It is so much easier to get to the room without having to go through the casino. This property would work best for people who has a rental car, otherwise staying on the Strip would be most convenient. The free breakfast in the morning is a plus. There is no resort fee charge which can add quite a bit to the room cost.
Room Tip: High floor, away from elevator

Hotel is very clean.  Was greeted by warm staff from the moment I walked in.  Nice restaurant and bar.  Would stay again.  Staff is always the best! Accommodate every request.  Very nice hotel for a very reasonable rate. Very comfortable night sleep, friendly and attentive staff. One Bistro is a very nice restaurant. The best onion soup I have had.  This was our first time to stay at a Four Points hotel and we will definitely return - especially to this one in Norwood.The seasonal decorating outside with flowers and pumpkins made a wonderful 1st impression and was so welcoming! It appeared to be a very busy weekend with several weddings but the front desk was well staffed and everyone we spoke to was very pleasant and helpful. The room was very quiet and comfortable. We loved the sleek wall-mounted shampoo, conditioner & shower gel station, instead of having all the little bottles cluttering up the counters. Nice hotel, nice staff, good value.  1st the hotel is so dated, everything is loose, like the door handle, door lock, shower handle etc.  The a/c /heat is blowing right in front of the bed that gives me a massive margin.  On top of that on Sat night about 0150 there's lots of noise and loud come across the hall and so I kinda let it go, as people need a bit of time to catch up etc then when it comes to 0238 still never die down, so I've called down to the front desk and complain and so they sent a security guy up.  He (Security guy) knock on my door and ask did we call to complain about the noise!!!  First of all why is he knocking on my door and had to get up OUT OF BED to confirm !!!!  Does he not see that the noise literally across from my door?!?!?!?!  I was NOT a happy camper for him to drag me out of bed to answer the door for something like that!!!!!!!!!  When I check out I didn't get a print out as they offer to e-mail to be more environmentally which I understand and they did confirm we had A (ONE) charge from the restaurant.  When I come home at the bottom it said double the charges.  I'm not sure am I reading it wrong but it said Total: $50 something as there's two charges for $20 something!  So I had to called and the front desk girl doesn't seem to understand.  So she claim she only see one charge and I've asked her to e-mail that to me and what it turns out to be the 3rd e-mail I've received to be the exact same thing that the total charge is fifty something dollars!  I've ask her to get back to me   from the moment we walked in, the employees made us feel welcome and answered all of our questions. The room was very nice and modern. I enjoyed the workout facility as well .  Went to the game could not get back in. Nothing stating doors are locked after 1130.   Assumed card swipe would open doors.  But no.   In a football town they should have services open for people getting in in the early morning hours   Stayed at this hotel on the way back from helping our daughter move into an apartment in Boston.  Have never stayed at a Sheraton, got an excellent rate on Expedia.  It is a large, updated property with banquet facilities, on-site restaurant and bar, separate breakfast area off the lobby, lovely pool area with jacuzzi.  The room was beautiful, perfect for 2 people; queen size bed had nicer than average bedding and was very comfortable.  Furnishings were very nice, plenty of drawer space; bathroom was very clean, lots of towels, shower stall seemed larger than average and had dispensers on shower wall with body wash, shampoo and conditioner, what a great idea.  My only complaint was that I found the on-site restaurant to be very expensive, however there are lots of restaurants just down the street so we just went to a hibachi place.  Every front desk employee we met was super helpful and friendly.  Hotel is in great location, just off I-95 and it's a quick trip into Boston.  I would stay there again and would highly recommend.  Great location, attentive staff, nice facilities and price is comparable to nearby lesser hotels. Will definitely stay here again   I checked in late so I couldn't enjoy all the amenities the hotel had to offer but I loved the room. Most comfortable bed ever! Staff was friendly and courteous. Very enjoyable experience.   Hotel isn't too far from Gillette stadium, which is where we were coming from. Staff was very friendly, from the front desk to the restaurant. Our room was perfectly clean. There was a slight odor (I couldn't really place it) in the hall, but not in the room. The HVAC and the room was quiet. Not much of a view but the property was nice, clean, and well landscaped. The room was on the small side but it was enough space for my wife and myself. We weren't blown away by the breakfast, but it was nice that they had a large variety. We didn't get a chance to eat in the bistro, as it's not open for breakfast. I would not hesitate to stay here again, or recommend it to anyone in the area.  The curtains in the hotel room do not close to block out the light.  This is insane to me.  I typically don't like when people give a hotel a bad review over one tiny issue, but this issue had just too big of an impact on our stay to ignore.In the summer the sun rises at 6am.  Meaning our room was flooded with daylight at 6am.  The morning after a concert at Gillette stadium.Insane.  The staff was incredible, especially Linda at the Front Desk. Offered tips getting to Gillette then in the morning asked how the concert went... Just added to an already great weekend  The hotel appearance was excellent upon entry. I had a girl help me check in. She was unable to accommodate my request& needed help. The woman who  helped started with NO... This did not impress me. She even just walked away. The young girl still tried and a manager came over, asked me questions about my needs and worked it out...that was customer service! All I needed was my two rooms to be together because we had teenagers with us.  The rooms were close and one was switched to a suite. She even comped us breakfast due to the inconvenience.  We asked for a early check in they made it happen and were more than happy to do it.  We came for a concert. Checked in late. Our room was VERY clean and the bed was a memory foam top. Super comfy. The only issue was the shower head was either trickle or narrow jet stream. Def would stay again. Hotel is beautiful and seems recently upgraded.  Room was neat and clean.

5,8278,"     Royal Resort, Las Vegas Reviews Page 9  Great price,service and location Its not your most luxurious hotel, but extremely close. Its location at the beginning of the strip was amazing and the service was very hospitable. Rooms were decent sized and the balcony was great. The gambling pay out was awesome and the pool and cabanas were relaxing.  Excellent value for money and no resort fee!! Lovely hotel, quick check-in, great rooms, great price, friendly staff, what more could you ask for?

I was also impressed that when we left our bags in the safe room we were asked to describe them before we could get them back, nice to know someone can't just take them!

The only complaint is the wifi, one day for $10 is outrageous, cheaper to go and use McDonalds up the road!  Convention Center Convenience I attended a convention at the Convention Center and the hotel is a 12 minute walk from the venue. Convention Center has free parking, so actually driving made more sense in the 111 degree heat. The hotel is also located 1/2 a block from The Strip (close to the Riviera). Besides The Barrymore, hotel restaurant, there is a Denny's across the street through the Ross store. The room was clean and spacious. King size bed, table and chairs, additional lounge chair. Looks like a Murphy Bed was also available. Balcony isn't really a balcony, sliding glass doors that opened onto a rail to hang your pool towel. I used the pool one evening, very refreshing. Front desk folks were very friendly and helpful day and night.
Room Tip: 6th floor pool view. Very quiet.
See more room tips  An ideal poker players resort Our second stay at the Royal; which should say something. We've stayed at all the big strip hotels over the years but when you remember that you mainly sleep there, we wondered why we spent the money.

The Royal is a time share resort of an average standard - probably a converted hotel from the 70's but it's fine. Check in is extremely fast, unlike the Venetian, the staff are helpful and you don't get any time share sales pitches at all.

Location is good being just 5 minutes walk from the Wynn poker room! And there is a Denny's just across the road which is perfect for breakfast at 3pm! Or dinner at 4am!!! Well, we play a lot of poker!

The room is as expected and as you see in the photos. Adequate comes to mind. A/C is standard and needed in the summer months and the mini fridge is a great help if you take tea bags and use milk...or beer!

Overall the place is clean, tidy, very quiet and the maid service is flexible...although our cleaner seemed unable to dust! Other than that a great place to stay at not a lot of money.

We'll be going back there again for sure!
Room Tip: If you expect to sleep during the day ask for a room on the opposite side of the pool.

Room Tip: Stayed here a few times city or pool view is your choice.
See more room tips  If you are not fussed by staying at a big name hotel... I spent two nights at the Royal Resort while in Vegas recently, and found the experience to be quite a pleasant one. I was not too fussed by the need to stay at one of the big name hotels (and in fact every time I visited one of those, there were check in lines a mile long)

Royal Resort is about two thirds of the way down the strip near the Riviera - making it nice and central to most things. The property is a little dated, but I can't fault the staff, cleanliness or the price!

The other big advantage of being slightly away from the centre of the strip is that once you retreat to your room form the night - it is nice and quiet!

There is a discount ticketing outlet on site and right next door are a range of supermarkets, restaurants, liquor stores and convenience outlets.

The place felt safe enough and there are security guards on duty at night - and the walk to and from the main parts of the strip also felt safe.

I'd certainly consider staying again next time I am in Vegas.

I'd certainly  Great place, if you know what to expect I've owned a timeshare at the Royal for at least 8 years, however have never actually stayed as a timeshare guest. However, we book and stay here at least once a year for a shorter stay (3-5 nights) and love it. Here's what it's not - it's not a casino property. It's not glitz and glam. What it is is conveniently located, sufficiently quiet and relaxed, but just steps away from fun, food and more. We love waking up and making our way to the Peppermill for breakfast. The restaurant in the Royal is fabulous and to my knowledge has become a very popular place for locals. The new hidden gem (or not so hidden) is the Tijuana Taco place in the strip mall right next to the hotel on the strip (not the real name, but you won't miss it if you ask anyone). The hotel also has a nice pool and spa out back. All in all, it's a nicely located, convenient property that is as clean as any normal hotel/motel across the country.  No Royal treatment here! Booked hotel through Booking.com for a one night stay May 31st. Booked a SMOKING room and received a confirmation for our stay. Upon arrival we got to our room and found there was not any ashtrays. My wife called the front desk and was told that all smoking rooms had been taken. We informed the clerk we had a SMOKING room reservation and he again said they were out. Then suggested we just smoke by the patio door. Really? Normally it wouldn't be an issue except for the fact that ANY changes made by me to the reservation would have resulted in a $25 minimum fee. I think if a property expects you to stick to your reservation they should too! Patio is about an 18 inch extension with sliding door. A normal sized person cannot stand or sit outside. Our sink drain did not work properly. No Bell hop to assist with luggage and location is not that great. Limited Valet as well. After this I would rather stay at Motel 6. That sums it up and I don't usually stay at Motel 6 for a reason.
Room Tip: Find another location
See more room tips  Nice place , great price Pleasantly surprised the lobby is decorated very unique . Consear was great because he had lots of great information .Room was nice and had a balcony.it was nice to be able to stand out side on are on balcony.would definitely stay there again.  Decent hotel, close to Convention Center.  The Royal was a decent hotel, nothing terribly fancy. It's obviously an older establishment, but the rooms were pretty clean. I've stayed here twice in the last few years.

Booking in took about 10 minutes, as there was only one agent at the desk who was constantly distracted by her cellphone.

The rooms were Vegas-typical, nothing to write home about, but comfortable enough.
The restaurant on-site was way to pricey for us, so we opted for some in the vicinity (within a block or two).
Located in a sort of run-down section of town, which is currently undergoing renovations, the views and neighborhood definitely lacks appeal. The Convention Center was about 5-10 minutes away walking time, dependent on traffic. Flagging down a cab is most difficult as local ordinances prohibit cabs from picking up passengers on the side of the road; the front desk did call a cab for us and a few other groups of folks who were waiting, but it was sort of a free-for-all when they finally showed up.

If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive hotel close to the Convention Center, you could do worse... But could probably justify a few more dollars and stay a block closer in one of the major chain hotels.    ",0.55,0.92,0.45,"""neutral""","   Staff is very nice.  Hotel is dated and musty.

The eggs and sausage were served from a different side window and not the buffet table so many like us did not even notice until one guest asked the lady and then lots of people got up and went for eggs. When she served the eggs she just gave everyone eggs and sausage even if they asked for eggs, no smiles no talk I wouldn't say rude , but she just didn't have customer service attitude. Oh and she didn't keep the fruit stocked up. No bananas left despite the fact I could see a box of fruit in the room where she served out of. Otherwise everything else was great.

Breakfast was excellent. Very filling.   We enjoyed our stay in Yarmouth. Hotel is centrally located and was very comfortable.  My boyfriend, myself and my small dog stayed for 3 nights during Nova Scotia music week and were pretty disappointed unfortunately. The first night was great, everything was clean and comfortable. The staff didn't seem to be too friendly at first but throughout the trip they seemed to get better. One of the days I was leaving the room, housekeeping asked if I wanted service. I said yes. I said I wanted the full service and specifically asked for my sheets to be changed. When I got back, the room was okay however the sheets were not changed. The one thing I specifically asked for. They also left cleaning supplies in the bathroom. For the last night, I left my dog in the room while my boyfriend and I went out to enjoy some of the music. Unfortunately the room next to ours was having some kind of a party and it was scaring my dog. When I arrived I gave the hotel my phone number incase anything like that happened so they can call me and I could come tend to her.  They did call, and left a very rude message. ""Come care for your dog, we don't want to have to charge another guests room to your bill due to the disturbance."" The tone, the threat, all of it was unacceptable. I work at a full service hotel myself and know how these situations are supposed to be handled. I immediately came back to the hotel and calmed the situation. I was shocked that I was called about my dog, however the room beside us was still partying by the time we got back. I won't be back.   Breakfast wasn't great but overall a good experience.   Very quick and polite check in. Room very comfortable clean and quiet.  Hotel check-in staff were perfunctory at best, I was left to find my own way to the room through the oddly located (and unsigned) stairwell. The hotel is on the main drag on the way into Yarmouth and despite being surrounded by places, there is basically no pedestrian infrastructure so be prepared to trek across car parks, jaywalk across 3 lanes of traffic, or get back in your car. The breakfast was limited at best, not recommended. Worryingly, the hotel has a sharps policy (for things like syringes(!)) and a no-shirt-no-shoes-no-service policy, which perhaps tells you something of the pitch.

When I booked this hotel thru Expedia a month ago, your people or system computers never sent an electronic confirmation to the hotel's computer. Fortunately, they still had a room left for us to book. I called Expedia and they rebooked the reservation for us, since your company goofed big-time.

Quiet and very comfortable hotel with excellent staff This is a quiet and very comfortable hotel for individuals or families traveling through Las Vegas who do not want the chaos of the casinos and Las Vegas strip. Staff was very accommodating and professional. Good breakfast with espresso coffee. Highly recommend when in Vegas.  Great hotel! Stayed at this hotel during our trip to Vegas. It's a really nice hotel in a quiet area of Vegas, away from the strip. Very nice large room for a reasonable price. The staff was also really nice. We had taken a red eye into Vegas and landed at midnight. They had a bunch of samples at the desk and I was able to get toothpaste and a razor right away! Breakfast was also good. Definitely recommend staying here!  Las Vegas We were very satisfied with this hotel. Off the strip and downtown but close enough to be there in minutes. We were heading North out of town so this was very convenient. Our room was fantastic with a Jacuzzi in the room. The breakfast was standard but very fresh and well stocked. Would stay at this hotel again.  Nice place at an affordable rate We had one of the handicapped equipped rooms on the 2nd floor (which is actually at ground level). Unfortunately we could hear every step in the room above us which was a bit annoying but that was pretty much the worst of it. Room was clean and smelled good. Towels and sheets were great and even the pool towels were nicely sized and not the postage stamp size that you often get. Breakfast is adequate, but this morning they were out of eggs/omelette so that was disappointing. Staff is friendly and courteous. Would definitely recommend this place to friends and consider staying here again.
Room Tip: Go for the top floor if you can.
See more room tips  Best hotel and amazing customer service!!! This was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Hotel was beautiful, breakfast in the morning was so good, the staff was exceptional, especially Jose who was the nicest most professional front desk employee I have ever met! I definitely will be back in vegas, and this my hotel of choice!  Quiet &amp; comfortable Away from the Strip but within easy distance. Near Summerlin. No casino noise to deal with. Staff is very helpful. Rooms are comfortable and the breakfast has variety. Coffee always available whether in the breakfast room or in room where there is a Keurig and a refrigerator.
Restaurants at all levels within very easy walking distance. Bed and pillows comfortable. Only things missing were an in-room safe and a lighted make-up mirror. I definitely recommend for those who want to be away from the hubbub and noise of the Strip, and want to get around easily to the other areas of Las Vegas. There is a small in-door pool and gym. Free wifi.  Look no further! Look no further when looking for a nice place to lay your head! The staffs professionalism here is as or better than some overpriced hotel on the strip. The GM has been nothing short of amazing on every facet of her business. I have been a guest here since January due to business and cant say enough good things about my stay. From the heated indoor pool to the quality of the high speed internet and the amazing breakfast this hotel does not disappoint!  Nice Location This is a pleasant location a few miles west of the strip next to Summerlin. There are many restaurants of all types nearby from fast food (next door) to high end at Tivoli Village or Downtown Summerlin. Best of all, they do not charge the $25/day resort fee of the casino hotels.
Room Tip: The handicap rooms do not have a bathtub. Also the bathroom lighting was dim.

There was no refrigerator or iron, only visible spaces where they used to be. The microwave would not work. The travel size amenities were half used, but the two bars of soap were nicely sealed. If we were not so exhausted or had kids with us, we would not have stayed.  The place is worn at the edges but clean with wood floors in rooms (cleaner than carpet). Non h d tv but a great price on Expedia vs walk in rate  Only reason I stayed here was because it was close to Bristol motor Speedway. Of course they jacked up the rates way high to take advantage of the Battle of Bristol football game. Staff was OK and helped with an early checkin.  However the property is run down and is just a step or so above a drive-in motor lodge .  I stayed at the hotel for the Battle of Bristol football game between Virginia Tech and Tennessee. The hotel, with traffic, is only 30 minutes from the Speedway which is closer than I thought it would be. There are tons of restaurants and shops right by the hotel in Johnson City which I didn't expect. Overall, I was very happy with having stayed here and would do it again.  Our door was broken when we got there. The hotel staff didn't know how to fix it so my boyfriend and I had to do it... Then the tv didn't work and the lights wouldn't come on. The bathroom was nasty and the the door stuck and we found a crack pipe in the door... I will never stay here again   If you are desperate and low on funds this is the place.  Otherwise spend a bit more and have a better experience.  Pretty old and run down.  Beds were uncomfortable.  TVs were very old.  The breakfast in the morning was a joke, terrible.  The room had bedbugs, when I told the front desk they said they would close the room but offered no concessions on this stay or on one I had booked for later in the week.  There was a nail sticking out of the baseboard about 1 1/2"" that was in a very hazardous place that could present a danger to guests and pets.  The towels were the smallest and thinnest bath towels I have ever experienced and the sheets had holes in them.  Obviously, I canceled my stay for the return leg of my trip.  There was a big tear in the wall paper and it was nearly peeling off the wall just outside the bathroom.  Very disappointing for the price. Limited choices for breakfast. Room was dirty.  The room was clean and quiet.  Needs some updating but overall was fine.  Breakfast bar had no fruit or cereal but had continental breakfast items and waffle maker.  Wi-fi worked fine as well.  the room was great. the bed was just right for both of us because we both have back problems. i would stay there again.  Supposed to be ""non smoking"" room smelled horrible, when we checked in to the room the bathroom light was on and the tv was on and it looked like someone had been sitting on the bed. Also we were called twice during the night!!!   This hotel is old, outdated. Need to be upgraded ASAP.  Mold in the bathroom, loud neighbors above and outside  The clientele left something to be desired. You can tell it is the cheapest hotel around. Very old needs a severe update and overhaul  Stained carpets, bedsheets had holes in them, one tiny bar of soap, mold in shower  I had a nice room on the first floor so it was so good for the little dog! Motel 6 is such a value and so pet friendly, we will stay again and again.  Nasty room .Had cockroaches in floor. Price was good, but overall experience wasn't pleasing.  The staff is incredibly nice and helpful.  Our room was nice but don't look for any ""extras"" like shampoo, etc.  We stayed 5 nights and were comfortable.  Staff were excellent and couldn't do enough to help.  The perfect location when staying in Paris.  I have traveled to Paris many times, and this hotel is simply the best there is.  Location is right in the heart of everything, views are stunning of the gardens and Orsay.  The restaurant Angelina;s next door has by far the worlds most amazing hot chocolate, it is a must.  The room and staff were exceptional.  Will go back again and again....  You can't help but love the location right at the Tuileries. Everything is walking distance. The staff are fabulous and rooms are bigger than most and very classic French. Loved it.   My daughter and I had a very comfortable night. The staff were very helpful and the location is perfect for sightseeing. WIll return one day hopefully!   My stay at the Hotel Brighton was AMAZING. Beautiful, clean and comfortable. The staff were so nice and helpful. It was in a great location near the Pyramides Tours. Perfect for the tour I booked early in the morning. I would definitely stay here again.  Staff outstanding.  Room very comfortable.  Staff helpful  The location is perfect, the metro is just across the street. The staff was really helpful and friendly.  My room was spacious and always neat. I highly recomend this hotel  We enjoyed our stay. The breakfast was delicious and comfy bed.  The staff very attentive and took care of all requests.  It was especially nice to be called by name.  Great location and great price and while the staff seemed like they wanted to assist they didn't. Room was very small but that's typical in Paris. I asked for change twice which they did not have. Gave me the wrong adapter for our electronics. I wanted pizza and they sent me to an Italian restaurant that didn't have pizza. Their car service was supposed to pick me up at the airport but never showed up, I had to take a taxi.   Great place to stay. The location is perfect to walking around the city. The hotel staff were very nice and helped with recommendations. I would highly recommend Hotel Brighton.  No conscierge. Staff helpful and friendly. Location superb.   We enjoyed being walking distance from the major sites.   Good service and close to metro.(very important). Quite centralize to point of interest in the city. Room is okay with clean bathroom and bed. Internet slow and small lift.  Perfect location and amazing staff. We will return.  Hotel is very accessible via subway and train from the airport. Once there location s excellent walking distance to all attractions and restaurants. Hotel itself is very comfortable high ceilings and nicely appointed rooms.  Great location, loved it!

There are tons of restaurants and shops right by the hotel in Johnson City which I didn't expect. Overall, I was very happy with having stayed here and would do it again.  Our door was broken when we got there. The hotel staff didn't know how to fix it so my boyfriend and I had to do it... Then the tv didn't work and the lights wouldn't come on. The bathroom was nasty and the the door stuck and we found a crack pipe in the door... I will never stay here again   If you are desperate and low on funds this is the place.  Otherwise spend a bit more and have a better experience.  Pretty old and run down.  Beds were uncomfortable.  TVs were very old.  The breakfast in the morning was a joke, terrible.  The room had bedbugs, when I told the front desk they said they would close the room but offered no concessions on this stay or on one I had booked for later in the week.  There was a nail sticking out of the baseboard about 1 1/2"" that was in a very hazardous place that could present a danger to guests and pets.  The towels were the smallest and thinnest bath towels I have ever experienced and the sheets had holes in them.  Obviously, I canceled my stay for the return leg of my trip.  There was a big tear in the wall paper and it was nearly peeling off the wall just outside the bathroom.  Very disappointing for the price. Limited choices for breakfast. Room was dirty.  The room was clean and quiet.  Needs some updating but overall was fine.  Breakfast bar had no fruit or cereal but had continental breakfast items and waffle maker.  Wi-fi worked fine as well.  the room was great. the bed was just right for both of us because we both have back problems. i would stay there again.  Supposed to be ""non smoking"" room smelled horrible, when we checked in to the room the bathroom light was on and the tv was on and it looked like someone had been sitting on the bed. Also we were called twice during the night!!!   This hotel is old, outdated. Need to be upgraded ASAP.  Mold in the bathroom, loud neighbors above and outside  The clientele left something to be desired. You can tell it is the cheapest hotel around. Very old needs a severe update and overhaul  Stained carpets, bedsheets had holes in them, one tiny bar of soap, mold in shower  I had a nice room on the first floor so it was so good for the little dog! Motel 6 is such a value and so pet friendly, we will stay again and again.  Nasty room .Had cockroaches in floor. Price was good, but overall experience wasn't pleasing.  The staff is incredibly nice and helpful.  Our room was nice but don't look for any ""extras"" like shampoo, etc.  We stayed 5 nights and were comfortable.  Staff were excellent and couldn't do enough to help.  The perfect location when staying in Paris.  I have traveled to Paris many times, and this hotel is simply the best there is.  Location is right in the heart of everything, views are stunning of the gardens and Orsay.  The restaurant Angelina;s next door has by far the worlds most amazing hot chocolate, it is a must.  The room and staff were exceptional.  Will go back again and again....  You can't help but love the location right at the Tuileries. Everything is walking distance. The staff are fabulous and rooms are bigger than most and very classic French. Loved it.   My daughter and I had a very comfortable night. The staff were very helpful and the location is perfect for sightseeing. WIll return one day hopefully!   My stay at the Hotel Brighton was AMAZING. Beautiful, clean and comfortable. The staff were so nice and helpful. It was in a great location near the Pyramides Tours. Perfect for the tour I booked early in the morning. I would definitely stay here again.  Staff outstanding.  Room very comfortable.  Staff helpful  The location is perfect, the metro is just across the street. The staff was really helpful and friendly.  My room was spacious and always neat. I highly recomend this hotel  We enjoyed our stay. The breakfast was delicious and comfy bed.  The staff very attentive and took care of all requests.  It was especially nice to be called by name.  Great location and great price and while the staff seemed like they wanted to assist they didn't. Room was very small but that's typical in Paris. I asked for change twice which they did not have. Gave me the wrong adapter for our electronics. I wanted pizza and they sent me to an Italian restaurant that didn't have pizza. Their car service was supposed to pick me up at the airport but never showed up, I had to take a taxi.   Great place to stay. The location is perfect to walking around the city. The hotel staff were very nice and helped with recommendations. I would highly recommend Hotel Brighton.  No conscierge. Staff helpful and friendly. Location superb.   We enjoyed being walking distance from the major sites.   Good service and close to metro.(very important). Quite centralize to point of interest in the city. Room is okay with clean bathroom and bed. Internet slow and small lift.  Perfect location and amazing staff. We will return.  Hotel is very accessible via subway and train from the airport. Once there location s excellent walking distance to all attractions and restaurants. Hotel itself is very comfortable high ceilings and nicely appointed rooms.  Great location, loved it! Will come back and stayVery clean, staff was good, everything was walking distance.   An excellent hotel and a perfect location.  All for a good price.  Upgraded to the exec suit and the view is just amazing.   Queen size beds, larger bathroom than other hotels we researched, great staff.   Paid cash for my room.they turned around and charged my credit card after I checked out.called them to complain was told they always put the price of room on your card for cleaning fee.water for shower was cold .room had water leak told them said they would bring towels for the floor   The staff tried to be helpful. The hotel, however, needs a lot of work! Waited 30 minutes at check in to find my reservation information. First room on the first floor was visibly dirty, linen terribly stained, and smell burned my eyes. Second room on third floor smelled better and was a bit cleaner. Definitely, quieter. The elevator was dirty. The king bed was completely sunken in the middle. There were visible stains on the carpet and we found a pair  of black leggings, turned inside out, behind the chair. There was no refrigerator or iron, only visible spaces where they used to be. The microwave would not work. The travel size amenities were half used, but the two bars of soap were nicely sealed. If we were not so exhausted or had kids with us, we would not have stayed.  The place is worn at the edges but clean with wood floors in rooms (cleaner than carpet). Non h d tv but a great price on Expedia vs walk in rate  Only reason I stayed here was because it was close to Bristol motor Speedway. Of course they jacked up the rates way high to take advantage of the Battle of Bristol football game. Staff was OK and helped with an early checkin.

7,8745,"     Holiday Inn Express Las Vegas South Hotel Reviews Page 9  Very pleasant Oct. 05 to 12 2013 The staff is very friendly and made you feel very welcome. The hotel upgraded us and it was a very nice room. They had a shuttle that took us to the strip and shopping. The only thing that would of been nice if they picked you up from the airport. The breakfast was good that was supplied. The hot tub was broken which was not fixed during our stay.
Room Tip: The area where the hotel is quiet but you are not on the strip you are about 10 minutes away by car.
See more room tips  Location, Location Pros: The HIE is close to the airport and close to LV attractions. They provide shuttle service to Mandalay Bay and New York  New York so you can get within walking distance to most of the casinos. The shuttle (common to the hotels in the immediate area) also can be reserved for a return to the airport. The rooms are standard HIE offerings  nothing special.
Cons: There is no shuttle service from the airport. Be prepared to take a taxi (about $15 plus tip). If you pick up a rental car you must take a bus from the terminal to the transportation center. If you are not familiar with the area, make sure you download directions.  Nice Stay This is a good place to stay on the fly when visiting in Las Vegas. They have a shuttle that will take you to the Mandalay Bay or New York New York. The shuttle is great! No having to get in the car and find parking if you want to walk the strip. Rooms are clean but be advise that there is no ice machine on the third floor. I found this out after walking the length of the third floor in socks only to get my feet wet as the carpet was soaked from those who were using the pool. After finding no ice machine in the usual places I had to go to the first floor to find the ice machine!
Room Tip: Be sure to get your ice before heading to your room if you are on the third floor. No Ice machine on...
See more room tips  Good Value Overnight stay, the location is off the strip but the hotel does offer a shuttle to the Mandalay Bay Convention Center, and New York Casino until 1 AM. They also have a morning Airport drop off shuttle. The taxi fare from the airport is about $25 to $30 one way. The room was clean and the hotel was fairly new. They offer free in room wifi and a good breakfast. The only problems we had were: didn't receive our wake up call, and they hadn't scheduled our morning airport shuttle, which we requested the night before. They were able to gets us on a shuttle that morning on time. I would stay here again.  Good value for trip to Las Vegas We spent one night here during a weekend trip to Las Vegas with friends.
The room was spacious and there was free wifi, but unfortunately no fridge. I believe they were available at a charge, but think this is disappointing for a Vegas location.
The bed was huge and comfortable, although the room looked slightly tired, probably just due to the age of the building. It was certainly clean and only the lack of fridge would stop me staying there again.
We didn't get a chance to try out the pool area, unfortunately.
Thoroughly enjoyed the free breakfast! Lots to choose from, including hot items, toast, bagels, muffins, jams etc. The orange juice in particular was lovely. What brand is it!
Well located, and there was also a shuttle bus, though I can't remember which big casino places it stopped at.
Free parking included, which is a bonus, and the staff were really helpful.  Very, very average hotel with great customer service This place was a very basic hotel, and that isn't saying much in Vegas. The customer service was exceptional, however, and it was very clean, so not bad if you are looking for an inexpensive off-strip hotel. I got my dad a junior suite for two nights and when we went to check him in the room was spacious and very clean. However the bed was quite large for the two small pillows on it and that looked a bit strange. The view from the window was almost totally blocked by the external part of the building. The strangest bit, perhaps, was that the clock radio looked very new, as did the rest of the building, but it played CDs and had no hook-up for MP3 players. Who travels with CDs anymore? I mean that's not essential, but the thing was huge and I just can't figure out why you would bother with such a massive, new piece of kit that very few people would use in this day and age. The pool was small and next to the parking lot, but blocked off by privacy fencing and very clean; we took my daughter swimming in it and it's good for kids. My dad said the breakfast was abysmal and he's not too picky, but I didn't see it first hand. Overall, if you're going for a short stay and don't want to be on the strip or are going for business on a budget, this is an ok place, mostly because the people working there were so incredibly nice, welcoming and accommodating at every chance to be so.  weekend get away this is a very clean hotel great customer service friendly staff the rooms were very nice had a great nights sleep wonderful bed very comfortable. they had a good breakfast a wide choise .only a cross the freeway from the strip. lots of parking nice work out room.  Great value and location I was so happy that we were NOT staying on the strip. This is just off the strip without all the noise and people. They have a free shuttle that will take you down but we did not have any problem driving ourselves and parking at the various hotels/casinos.

The beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. You do hear the airport noise but it didn't bother me. The breakfast is why I love to stay at Holiday Inns. Love it!

Staff were super friendly
Room Tip: Stay on the second floor if you want to do your own laundry. That is where you will find the very re...
See more room tips  Needs some work! Pleasant staff, especially at the morning breakfast buffet, but this hotel is definitely showing it's age. Ladder up for days in the lobby with wires hanging down. Cable TV service went out and they made it sound like Cox didn't even want to respond. Thermostat broken in the room so you had to control the AC at the unit with choice of blast or bigger blast - so without a thermostat you'd wake up around 2AM freezing. But the worst thing was the room REEKED of cigarette smell and when I complained about it at the desk when checking out the reply was ""oh, you're right below the smoking wing and it comes through the vents"" - if you know what the problem is FIX IT, my room was a non-smoking room!
Room Tip: If your room is on the third floor, west side and you don't smoke CHANGE your room - the smell o...
See more room tips  Love this place! Great location, nice rooms, easy parking, good breakfast, friendly staff, nice price. What else is there to say?

The access to the Strip and I-15 is easy. Been staying here for over 6 years on LV trips.

Recommended!    ",0.51,0.95,0.49,"""neutral"""," Good location right off Metro at Grands Blvd Station. Lots of restaurants and theatres nearby. Room is 3 stars. Service is ok. Good for simple travellers who are not picky and want to experience local Paris city life.   First night we arrived was greeted by receptionist. All went well and then I entered our room. The overwhelming smell of stale food hit us like a brick. After phoning down to see if this was a smoking room as it had a balcony I was rudely hung up on. Then a phone call from reception at 2330 to see if it was us In that room. First impressions were bad and it was only going to get worse. I read about soundproofed rooms. I wish. We were kept up all night with the goings on of our active neighbours. But a new day had come and as my wife showered she described it as being peed on from a height. I was next in the shower and soon found out that the shower head was embedded in dirt and grime. Which I had to clean. A great start to the day. as we were in a hotel that we didn't know we put our stuff In the safe and headed out and lastly put a do not disturb sign on the door. When we came back from a lovely day the sign had been taken off and the room had been entered. Ok no harm done some may say. I do not. By then we had new neighbours who were a rather large family and instead of giving them rooms next to each other they placed them at different places on our floor. So another disturbed night of children running in the corridors and doors slamming all night and early morning. The next morning we went out and as we had not had a proper sleep yet we returned mid afternoon to go for a nap. Again the maids presented themselves to the do not disturb sign by entering the room. Don't stay.   Good hotel generally, room small but adequate pity there is no sound proofing from adjacent rooms. Bathroom had been recently refurbished & was super.   The beds were heavenly and the location was great, however, the rooms were for very small.  Reception staff were extremely helpful. However our bedroom was fairly dark and the lighting within was poor.The bathroom was spacious, clean and light but towels a bit thin and towel rails were totally inadequate and shampoos a bit sparse. Breakfast buffet was limited as far as any hot dishes swede concerned but there was a good selection of pastries. Very handy for the Metro with a station just 30 metres from the entrance, however we could hear the rumble of the trains within our bedroom.  Room too small. Mattress past its life. Room not serviced. Breakfast paid for but supplies lacking.  Booked 3 rooms for 2 nights on a business trip. My room was great, slightly thin walls on one colleagues' room but otherwise great, aircon not working on the third room. This was reported and ignored twice and I think it was a big problem with other guests too. It is often the case in Paris, where the aircon is temperamental.Not helpful in 35 degree heat though. Would book again despite the hiccup.  the hotel is very shabby - old and in desperate need of a remodel - room was very hot - air conditioner hardly worked and no sheet on the bed - just a duvet so couldnt use it as it was too hot. the staff were great and very accomdating and the location was great but would not stay again due to the rooms being so uncomfortable.  Rubbish - it is difficult to find and when you do the rooms are too small (not just my experience), the staff miserable and it is pricy.  We had a superior room and had an excellent stay. The bed was comfy and the large French windows made the room airy. The shower was good and the room was very clean. Good location, near plenty of cafe's and the metro.   although it was my business trip I really did enjoy the stay here at Best Western Ronceray Opera. Eating, shopping, transportation, sight seeing, everything was possible due to a great location.  Very central and easy to get around  .  The main problem was in finding the hotel, the entrance being hidden along a small arcade.  It would help to know that it is next to the Gifren waxworks museum in arcade Jouffrey.    Very clean and comfortable. Really close to most tourist attractions. Easy to get to from the airport. Recommended!  The staff was pleasant and helpful. The rooms were very nice and clean with a large bathroom.  This Hotel is in renovation works for more than one year.No improvements can be seen. Dirty floors, cleaning of the room very disapointing, mattress from the 19th century for shure, WI-FI not working. Public areas of the Hotel, like the bar, are rented for private activities. Only one lift for the hole hotel, staff use it all morning,so it's almost impossible to get it.I will never return. I will not recommend this Hotel.  not very pleasant they gave me the worst room... internet was off... however the staff offered that I use their office, the stay was not up to my expectation  Staff was welcoming and nice. Changed our rooms due to me being tall and shower height being small. Breakfast in the morning was good...time and money saver... Size of room was good.  You get what you pay for... Plenty of restaurants within walking distance and the Metro station (100m or so) can connect you to any place in Paris.   The hotel is situated on a fairly lively street full of good bars and restaurants (bring plenty of money if you're planning to drink!).  We checked in fairly smoothly and found our room had an incredible view of Sacre Coeur.  Might be worth requesting a room on at least the second floor and facing away from the front street to be sure of that view.  The room itself was clean, though a little on the small side - shouldn't be an issue as you're not going to be staying in there long with all of Paris to explore.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  Booked through yourselves on the day , but when we arrived they said they didn't know anything about it , as ""our emails were down.""    .........as a result they gave us a room with no air conditioning (presumably as they hadn't let it out as it wasn't up to scratch)..... was way too hot for 2 nights.  This hotel is wonderful! It has a cute, historical-French, comfortable decor in the rooms and lobby. I loved the lace window curtains and pretty, flowered bedspread. The bathroom was modern -- with a tub, too! Everything was spotlessly clean, and the bed was great for good sleeping. The front desk staff and housekeeping staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The hotel also has a casual cafe and a regular restaurant with breathtaking views from its outdoor and indoor seating. The food at both places was delicious! I really enjoyed my stay, and highly recommend this hotel.   Extremely helpful staff, perfect location, free parking in front of hotel.  Fast check in and check out. Excellent valet who is skilled at moving cars around in their tiny car park lot. Did not try the restaurant due to many many places to eat steps from the hotel but breakfast is offered. very close to the Cite Reilgieuse. Overall, I would stay again.   It is not the hotel's fault that it is so hard to park, but it doesn't help that the hotel is located in the middle of a pedestrian zone. You can drive your car there to leave with a valet, but no one tells you that so you arrive wondering where is my hotel and how many more hours must I look for parking. No exaggeration. The hotel should make an effort to inform guests of this problem. As for the hotel itself, the beds are really comfortable and the room clean. If I were to go back I might try the other big hotel, but I imagine neither is a draw in itself.  Nice location in the middle of the old town. The restaurant was very good. Lovely little place.  Fabulous hotel, almost a boutique hotel, perched on the side of Rocamodur with views of the valley.  There is a gracious and traditional French restaurant with windows on the valley side.  A small, friendly bar with a local aperitif, omelettes, burgers, and beer fronts the street side.  In season, a perfectly situated terrace, and for the lucky few, parking!  The staff was friendly, helpful, and kind regarding my extremely poor French.  Couldn't find a better location in Rocamadour - and with car parking!Friendly, helpful staff, excellent restaurant.   The hotel is about as central as you can get, to the point that it is difficult to weave through the pedestrian crowds to get to it. Location is everything but the rooms were very nice. The restaurant was good but not as good as it thinks and we had better value meals and better service elsewhere.  What a wonderful hotel. Right in the heart of Rocamadour. We parked right outside the hotel, the staff came out to greet us. They offered us a choice of 2wonderful rooms, both of which were lovely. I stay in a lot of hotels, but this one was exceptional for its location, great staff and the most comfiest bed!I can't wait to return to Racamadour and wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Best Western.Didn't have breakfast or dinner there but the restaursnt and bar looked lovely with a good menu.  We stayed at the walled mideaval city of Rrocamadour. This hotel almost transported back to the times of 13th century France. Hard to explain the location, the views and cliffs. The narrow walls of a city well preserved from the times that surrounds it. The food was amazing and so was the sights and sounds  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Parking was a major relief given the very tight fit and rather stressful arrival to the hotel location. The dinner at the hotel restaurant was first rate and the view was fabulous. Breakfast was convenient and offered an ample variety.  What a lovely hotel in a superb spot - as you drive around the gorge on the bendy road, you suddenly see the village clinging to the cliff, with with its turrets and towers and the ancient stone entrance arch that doesn't look big enough to drive your car through, but you can, then down the narrow cobbled street and then you see your hotel. The hotel is in 2 parts - the very old part, where you find reception is on the right all dark wood and tapestries. The car park is on the right on the other side of the road, next to the restaurant, bar and bedrooms. We had taken our cat Elvis with us (long story!) and the hotel were happy to accommodate pets in the room. The hotel room was in the roof of the new building - really warm, cosy and modern with wooden beams, and a patio door to look down over the gorge with great views. The room had a hairdryer,TV (BBC), a huge comfortable bed, bath and shower. No coffee making facilities but a good bar and restaurant downstairs. We ate the 26 Euro 3 course meal at the restaurant overlooking the gorge, which was excellent. The food was cooked to perfection with big portions. I couldn't fault this hotel in any way - the staff were helpful and friendly and spoke English, the rooms were good, as was the food and the location is absolutely magical.  Nice staff, perfect location, good breakfast. All that for a great price.  Excellent reception, large room, great view, best retaurant in Rocamadour, quiet A/C that really worked. Verry good parking and excellent location in the centre.  Rocamadour, a three star attraction, is perched on the side of a rock clift valley so that the hotels and restaurants have rather spectacular views. It is a busy tourist center so arrive late in the day when the street (just one) is less crowded but the shops, restaurants and historic sights are still open.  Great location with stunning views from rooms in the extension over the restaurant. Our room was over the street side but no noise or distraction from a good sleep. Good aircon in rooms and all public areas. Menu in restaurant. We stayed one night in June, I imagine it could be a lot busier in peak season. Good hotel. Really pleased with the booking and service.  Hotel was fine. Attached restaurant served good meals and a great view of the valley. Breakfast buffet at 11E turned out to be a bargain. Maitre d' recommended good local wines with dinner. Service in hotel and restaurant was a little slow but friendly. Parking across the street was included and was extremely convenient.  hotel was in one of the most beutifull spots in france with beatifull views from both rooms of the valley and of the medival village that surrounds you.Exellent host at hotel . wonderfull experince , so wonderfull we couldnt leave straight away and so stayed another night.fully recomend to all.  hard to better for its location  Friendly helpful staff, wonderful restaurant, good clean rooms.

The hotel is about as central as you can get, to the point that it is difficult to weave through the pedestrian crowds to get to it. Location is everything but the rooms were very nice. The restaurant was good but not as good as it thinks and we had better value meals and better service elsewhere.  What a wonderful hotel. Right in the heart of Rocamadour. We parked right outside the hotel, the staff came out to greet us. They offered us a choice of 2wonderful rooms, both of which were lovely. I stay in a lot of hotels, but this one was exceptional for its location, great staff and the most comfiest bed!I can't wait to return to Racamadour and wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Best Western.Didn't have breakfast or dinner there but the restaursnt and bar looked lovely with a good menu.  We stayed at the walled mideaval city of Rrocamadour. This hotel almost transported back to the times of 13th century France. Hard to explain the location, the views and cliffs. The narrow walls of a city well preserved from the times that surrounds it. The food was amazing and so was the sights and sounds  The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Parking was a major relief given the very tight fit and rather stressful arrival to the hotel location. The dinner at the hotel restaurant was first rate and the view was fabulous. Breakfast was convenient and offered an ample variety.  What a lovely hotel in a superb spot - as you drive around the gorge on the bendy road, you suddenly see the village clinging to the cliff, with with its turrets and towers and the ancient stone entrance arch that doesn't look big enough to drive your car through, but you can, then down the narrow cobbled street and then you see your hotel. The hotel is in 2 parts - the very old part, where you find reception is on the right all dark wood and tapestries. The car park is on the right on the other side of the road, next to the restaurant, bar and bedrooms. We had taken our cat Elvis with us (long story!) and the hotel were happy to accommodate pets in the room. The hotel room was in the roof of the new building - really warm, cosy and modern with wooden beams, and a patio door to look down over the gorge with great views. The room had a hairdryer,TV (BBC), a huge comfortable bed, bath and shower. No coffee making facilities but a good bar and restaurant downstairs. We ate the 26 Euro 3 course meal at the restaurant overlooking the gorge, which was excellent. The food was cooked to perfection with big portions. I couldn't fault this hotel in any way - the staff were helpful and friendly and spoke English, the rooms were good, as was the food and the location is absolutely magical.  Nice staff, perfect location, good breakfast. All that for a great price.  Excellent reception, large room, great view, best retaurant in Rocamadour, quiet A/C that really worked. Verry good parking and excellent location in the centre.  Rocamadour, a three star attraction, is perched on the side of a rock clift valley so that the hotels and restaurants have rather spectacular views. It is a busy tourist center so arrive late in the day when the street (just one) is less crowded but the shops, restaurants and historic sights are still open.  Great location with stunning views from rooms in the extension over the restaurant. Our room was over the street side but no noise or distraction from a good sleep. Good aircon in rooms and all public areas. Menu in restaurant. We stayed one night in June, I imagine it could be a lot busier in peak season. Good hotel. Really pleased with the booking and service.  Hotel was fine. Attached restaurant served good meals and a great view of the valley. Breakfast buffet at 11E turned out to be a bargain. Maitre d' recommended good local wines with dinner. Service in hotel and restaurant was a little slow but friendly. Parking across the street was included and was extremely convenient.  hotel was in one of the most beutifull spots in france with beatifull views from both rooms of the valley and of the medival village that surrounds you.Exellent host at hotel . wonderfull experince , so wonderfull we couldnt leave straight away and so stayed another night.fully recomend to all.  hard to better for its location  Friendly helpful staff, wonderful restaurant, good clean rooms.  This hotel is wonderful! It has a cute, historical-French, comfortable decor in the rooms and lobby. I loved the lace window curtains and pretty, flowered bedspread. The bathroom was modern -- with a tub, too! Everything was spotlessly clean, and the bed was great for good sleeping. The front desk staff and housekeeping staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The hotel also has a casual cafe and a regular restaurant with breathtaking views from its outdoor and indoor seating. The food at both places was delicious! I really enjoyed my stay, and highly recommend this hotel.   Extremely helpful staff, perfect location, free parking in front of hotel.  Fast check in and check out. Excellent valet who is skilled at moving cars around in their tiny car park lot. Did not try the restaurant due to many many places to eat steps from the hotel but breakfast is offered. very close to the Cite Reilgieuse. Overall, I would stay again.   It is not the hotel's fault that it is so hard to park, but it doesn't help that the hotel is located in the middle of a pedestrian zone. You can drive your car there to leave with a valet, but no one tells you that so you arrive wondering where is my hotel and how many more hours must I look for parking. No exaggeration. The hotel should make an effort to inform guests of this problem. As for the hotel itself, the beds are really comfortable and the room clean. If I were to go back I might try the other big hotel, but I imagine neither is a draw in itself.  Nice location in the middle of the old town. The restaurant was very good. Lovely little place.  Fabulous hotel, almost a boutique hotel, perched on the side of Rocamodur with views of the valley.  There is a gracious and traditional French restaurant with windows on the valley side.  A small, friendly bar with a local aperitif, omelettes, burgers, and beer fronts the street side.  In season, a perfectly situated terrace, and for the lucky few, parking!

8,12206,"     Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport Hotel Reviews Page 9  close to the strip with affordable price nice people, room, fitness center... everything you need for a good stay in Las Vegas. All the personal are always very friendly. There is a swimming pool and the free breakfast is a decent one. If you don't want to spend a lot and stay in a quiet, clean, nice room... this is the place. And they have the 100% promise of total satisfaction.  Great location for Convention Center attendee The shuttles are convenient for the airport and Convention Center, and you are also close enough to walk. Every single person I dealt with over the phone and in person was so pleasant and aimed to please the customer. My room was clean and quiet.

Breakfast was good with plenty of choices.

I would stay there again even when visiting Vegas while not on business.  Great place! Excellent customer service. Great price! Good food. Convenient shuttle. Our room was clean. We had a stain on our bedspread but they changed it, no problem. Good layout of room. Microwave, fridge, coffee maker. Hot chocolate and coffee in lobby with fresh apples.  A great spot to get some rest The FFI off of Paradise Rd. in Las Vegas boasts three important value props - 1. Shuttle service to/from the airport, 2. It's within walking distance to the Sands convention center and 3. It's a great place to get some sleep, while battling long days/nights, when working a trade show in Las Vegas. The staff is great and breakfast is better than others I've recently stayed at.  Great Airport Hotel We booked the Fairfield Inn Airport as we we would be arriving late and heading out early the next day to head to southern Utah. We were checked in by a friendly staffer and offered choices from their little convenience shop which was a nice touch that we appreciated. The room was spacious, well equipped and spotless. And quiet. The included breakfast included hot options as well as standard continental choices.  Reasonable, great service Staying at the hotel was a last minute choice when other plans fell through. The front desk personnel couldn't have been nicer and were extremely helpful with dinner recommendations (""Firefly"" next door). The room was clean and adequate, no complaints. The AC was great, given how hot it was outside. And breakfast was a great benefit. Stay if you need to be away from the strip at a casual, friendly establishment.  Good Stay and Good Value Stayed here to attend a conference at a nearby casino. It is comfortable, clean and the staff was always very friendly and helpful. It has a lot of food choices within walking distance so it is good for those who didn't have a car like me. The airport shuttle is a great convenience as well! Breakfast is a little more sparse that what you will find at other places, but it has everything you need. The fitness center has two treadmills, a bike and a lat pull-down machine.  Wow a very nice boutique Fairfield Inn What a great totally remodeled Fairfield Inn. It really felt like a very upscale boutique hotel. This was directly after a six night stay at an upgraded room at Planet Hollywood. We stayed at Planet Hollywood to attend the Usual Suspects Network (USN) G6 gathering knife show. We booked a room at this Fairfield on day seven to get 10 hours of rest before our red eye back home to Florida.
This hotel was so nice and the girls at the desk were so nice and professional that next year when we go to Vegas for the USN G7 we are going to stay at this hotel rather than the casino hotel on the strip. The room was like a total upscale sanctuary. My wife and I really loved this hotel and it's only a couple of miles from the strip and the Airport.
Room Tip: All the rooms are great and stylishly remodeled.
See more room tips  Marriott Signature Comfort Excellent place for family, good free breakfast, airport shuttle..Marriott has excellent customer service..Highly recommended, I Love staying with Marriott all over the world. This Hotel just approx 1.2 miles from strip ...  Good Value This is a clean, efficient and convenient hotel. The shuttle service to the airport and the Wynne was excellent and timely, despite very heavy traffic in the city. Front desk was welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was very good. There are no views at this hotel. It's functional and was perfect for the one night before flying out of Vegas. Several restaurants just steps away.    ",0.57,0.9,0.43,"""neutral"""," The room as expected for this type of hotel though the soaps and such were a little nicer than usual. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The decor in the hotel is above average for the price level as well. Parking however is very cramped and there are not many spaces. The biggest plus about this hotel is the amazing restaurant. We had the best meal of our entire trip there (sad to say for the other purpose built restaurants that we dined in). Definitely try the noodles with beef. The breakfast buffet is also very good.  Great staff especially Chantal at check in. Half hour walk to centre. Clean. Easy to reach bus stop outside. Would recomend to stay here.   Good size room and Windows that can be opened. Room temperature ok but did wake up a little hot and needed to open window.  Good hotel within short walk of City Centre with friendly staff  Housekeepers made a lot noise in the morning during my stay, that bothered me a lot. They just putted towels in a bag, hanged on my door, because of my late woke up.   very pleasant place to stay, very clean, fantastic  The hotel was nice and clean. staff were very kind and friendly. Happy  Our stay was very pleasant, the staff were helpful and polite when we needed any assistance. I struggled to find the car park, which appeared to be the wrong side of a ""No Entry"" sign, once found it was perfectly adequate and proved secure and convenient. The room was clean,comfortable and quiet, if a little on the warm side. We enjoyed our stay.  Nice relaxing long weekend with staff always helpful and friendly  The hotel was busy on our arrival and parking in the hotel car park (free) was a bit difficult by the time of our late arrival. We were told that there was a Conference the next day. We were warmly welcomed and check-in was very quick and convenient. The room was well equipped, though the double bed was narrow - the layout of the room suggested that it was designed for a wider bed. A twin room would probably have been a better choice. Despite the fact that the room overlooked the road, there was no traffic noise, both because of the double glazing and because it was not a major thoroughfare. Check-out in the morning was very quick.  Staff were polite, spoke good English. Car Parking a little bit tight, but free and available. I had first floor room directly above entrance, unable to keep window open as smokers gathered below, made mistake of leaving open one day, came back to very smelly room. The rooms were neat and tidy and well serviced. Within walking distance of town 20mins, and on good bus route, running till midnight.  I had a comfortable stay in the hotel in my single room. The centre was within a good healthy walk. Cycle access is good. It was a quiet area.  nice hotel only 10 min walk to centretwo excellent thai restaurants and a chinese within 30 seconds of hotelfriendly staff,free parking  The hotel is in a really nice neighbourhood with cinema nearby and a great bakers. It was really nice to use as a base in Einhoven and to also make day trips from to Rotterdam and Dusseldorf. Van Abbemuseum a pleasant ten mins walk away, and city centre about the same. Would recommend. The lobby of hotel also comfortable with nice bar area. the hotel was a 25 min walk from train station.  The hotel is not too far of a walk to the nightlife and the main strip of cafes and shops, but it is far enough that you can get a quiet sleep at night. Very friendly staff and curteous.  expected more but not all satisfied.room very small and bath very smelly .after consulting the cleaning lady she said some problem with the drain tube.it does not deserf a 4 star because they have dispensers almost empty.when asking for other room .they said hotel is full.Not recomendable.  Nothing out of the ordinary to write, hotel was clean, comfortable, as you'd expect with an Accor group hotel really. Restaurant was good, service prompt, food reasonable. It's easy enough to find, and there was plenty of parking.  This hotel is convenient to walking to the old city in Helsinki and also either walking or taking a tram or taxi over to the cruise ports.  The hotel is being renovated and there are several steps to negotiate from the entrance through the restaurant and up 6-8 stair steps to the reservation desk as of Sept. 3rd.  We were given a newly renovated room on the 3rd floor with nice views of the port.  Although there were several streets below us we didn't notice any street noise.  The room was very nice,  the bed was super comfy and the bath toiletries were also very nice.  Breakfast was included with the price of our room.  Great choice of hot and cold selections.  Will stay here again and would certainly recommend to friends.   Definitely will be better (5 stars?) post construction, but the size and cleanliness of room, location that was residential and quiet, but still close to restaurants and shopping, and fridge, microwave and free movies in room far outweighed any minor construction inconveniences. Will def stay here again.  No indication was given at booking that the hotel was undergoing refurbishment. Room was shabby with questionable level of cleanliness. Most members of staff were very helpful but others did nothing to make the experience more palatable.  Unfortunately the internet was not working and there were elevator repairs and drilling that woke us up in the morning. The view was of a building site. The bed was super comfortable though and nice and big.   Shabby room and lobby under construction added lots of noise.  Nice hotel but under construction which ruined the experience.  Noise from 7 AM, mess and dust everywhere.  Instead of room with a pretty view which we put in special requests,  got a room facing backyard  looking very bad, all dug up with construction and stored supplies...  Nice room ,comfortable .The only  upseting thing  was renovation of the lobby ,it was difficult  with the luggages .Nice staff  Quick walk to the get to St. Petersburg's ferry. Friendly staff (Kaisa was great), tram access in front of the hotel, nice view.  When we booked the family room there was some confusion on our end.  Most hotels in Europe that we have encountered do not charge an additional fee for the third person if you book a three person room.  The rates are already higher than the double rooms. We had stayed at the Radisson Blu Plaza two weeks earlier and did not have the same issue, thus this was confusing.  We paid the addition fee for our child and the staff considered the circumstances and upgraded us to a Superior Room which was very nice.  The hotel is a fairly easy walk to the Ferry Terminal if you do not have too much luggage (and that is the reason we chose this location).  However, there is very little to do or see in the area otherwise (restaurants, sightseeing).  The beds are amazing and we had a decent view of the harbor.  Our rate included breakfast which was nice overall, but can't be compared to the Radisson Blue Plaza.  Due to heavy rain we also had dinner there one night of our stay and the food was pretty good and our service was outstanding.   Due to all of the construction the entrance was confusing and even hard to locate.  The lobby was almost nonexistent and chaotic.  Other than the construction issues the biggest issue was the nonstop sewer smell in the toilet closet (W/C) in our room.  It was extremely foul!  The good thing is that if you kept the door shut and with the windows open (no air-conditioning) the smell did not encroach into the rest of the room.  However, in the colder months wi  Spacious room and well equipped. However if I left the bathroom or toilet doors open the bedroom got smelly - maybe the exhaust fan was not working. Slow lifts but they appear under renovation. Good breakfast and friendly staff.  Great access to tram that takes you into city center.  It is located just steps from the hotel lobby.  The breakfast buffet is incredible!  Kind wait staff and greeters at breakfast.  Our deluxe room was spacious and comfortable.    The hotel is undergoing some renovation.  Did not affect our stay.  Very comfortable room,.  Friendly helpful staff, not far from the city centre ,no 6 tram right outside. Good clean room   Hotel was being updated- lots of work going on, but very clean and noise was minimal. Workers discreet and respectful.  The location of this hotel was a big driver for us as we could walk there from the port (~10 minutes). It also represented good value as the hotel has a nice sauna on site, especially compared to other hotels in Helsinki.  Worst hotel I've ever stayed in, receptionist at checkout was so abrupt and unfriendly not what you would expect when arriving at a hotel. Lunch was a buffet mainly catering for local workers . Corridors could do with a refurbish quite worn, Room was ok but too warm couldn't adjust the temperature. Didn't eat dinner at the hotel. Receptionist at checkout was very pleasant and helpful.   Reception staff was helpfull but comfort could be imporoved along with cleanlienss  Breakfast is good. Room has space. Service is nice.Only one thing need to complain is my room is at 6th floor, however, I need take other elevator to 7th floor, walk about 50 m, then take another elevator down to 6th floor.. that's a bit weird and not very convenient.  Enjoyed our stay, staff was very friendly and helpful , room were large and very clean!  Well located but hotel very noisy . Rooms are old , need to be renovated  This hotel is convenient to walking to the old city in Helsinki and also either walking or taking a tram or taxi over to the cruise ports.

Service is nice.Only one thing need to complain is my room is at 6th floor, however, I need take other elevator to 7th floor, walk about 50 m, then take another elevator down to 6th floor.. that's a bit weird and not very convenient.  Enjoyed our stay, staff was very friendly and helpful , room were large and very clean!  Well located but hotel very noisy . Rooms are old , need to be renovated ",0.72,0.56,0.28,neg
9,13316,"     Hampton Inn &amp; Suites Las Vegas-Red Rock/Summerlin Hotel Reviews Page 9  Just right for the money If you need to stay on the west side of Las Vegas, this hotel is just right. It's near 215, the price is very good (especially with AAA discount) and the included breakfast has decent variety and tastes very good.  Be careful where you walk First room didn't have window covering; second room had path in carpet; shower stall had broken handle; watch out for ""elephants"" above you that keep you up at night &amp; wake you early in the morning; look out for a racing treadmill; you may not get cable during your stay.  Don't Waste Your Money Here Until They Remodel The location worked to be near family. The staff was friendly. The rooms were the worst Hampton inn I HAVE EVER STAYED AT!!!!!!!!!! Beat up furniture, nasty carpeting and the walls were marked. Stay away for now!  Good overall quality; excellent staff! This hotel is a good value for the money. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The room could be cleaner; carpet was very worn and dirty. The linens seemed okay. The continental breakfast and complimentary internet makes the cost of the rooms okay. Otherwise the room value is more like a $69.00 value not over a$100.00, which is what I paid.  Great Stay Stayed here for a night and nothing but good things to say. The property is very well maintained. Great place to stay with kids. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was super clean. I felt very comfortable in this hotel. The breakfast was also great! Usually hotel breakfast buffets are hit or miss. This was definitely a hit. They had good options to choose from even for the health conscious crowd.  Reliable Typical of most all Hampton Inns, this one will suit you quite nicely. Beyond the good service and accommodation, the location is terrific for shopping, restaurants and reasonably quick access to downtown and the strip.  It is 43 degrees out, and the A/C is turned on in the hotel hallways I am a very frequent traveler, and as another guest and myself exited the elevator, we both looked at each other in amazement (which is kind of odd for two strangers to do this.....). But we exited the elevator to feel A/C blowing on ""full blast"" right into the hallways. I actually walked up and down all of the floors and found that the A/C was turned on full blast, EXCEPT for the first floor where everyone walks in.

Not to harp on this, but I presented the front desk about this issue, and she remarked I was the first guest to complain about it. I asked her if she wanted to just ride up to any floor and see it for herself (it is quite obvious you are walking into a freezing hallway the moment the elevator opens). She then replied that she was the only person actually working at the hotel at this time; and that she couldn't leave the front desk.

I asked if she could just turn the heat on floors 2/3/4 (because yes, you can actually feel cold air coming in under your door). She then replied that she has no control over this/does not know how. I find this to be ridiculous, you work at a hotel, and yet you do not know how to adjust the temperature?

I asked if there was maintenance around to look into the issue, and then she remarked that maintenance will not be in for another 12 hours or more (I checked in at 7pm). We did a little back and forth. I inquired about just what do you do..........when you have a maintenance event or any sort of thing that requires attention after 5pm.......who do you call? What do you do? Do you just literally say, tough luck (as I was told tonight). She could move me to another floor; but not a floor with an actual heated hallway (the first floor is the only floor heated).

All of her answers unfortunately did not inspire much confidence in this hotel - or the Hampton Inn brand in general. This will make 174 nights this year that I have stayed in a hotel, and this hotel has probably been one of the top 5 least impressive I have had the opportunity to stay at. this year.

I just thought of something, maybe I should stuff towels under the door to try and block the flow of cold air! Wish me luck :)
Room Tip: The Element by Westin is brand new and costs the same. Yet they have a lot more to offer on this sid...
See more room tips  Hampton Inn and Suites Upon arrival the Hampton looked wonderful. The hotel grounds seemed will taken care off the outside lighting was nice. When entering the lobby was very clean the front desk was nice. The overall appearance was inviting. It was late at night we had traveled many hours for a funeral so asked for a quiet room and was given a room on the 4th floor (not by a ice machine) :-) When we entered the room we was actually pretty shocked at what we saw. The room looked very ""old"" the carpet looked dirty, the bed spreads looked lumpy, very lumpy, the bathroom vanity looked like it was from a garage sale, the TV was sitting on the dresser not even in a entertainment center (I know this is a little picky but just looked weird) The chair in the corner also looked like a garage sale find. Also there was a humming noise that was WOW crazy. We had turned off the fan on the AC because it was to noise and ended up turning it back on to help drown out the jet engine noise we was hearing. It was soooo bad. Just not what you would expect from Hampton Inn. More of a lower chain quality.  Not the Best Place to Stay in Vegas The staff are very good at this hotel. However, the room we stayed in did not have a fridge. The lamp switches were loose or broken. The hair dryer was broken but the maintenance personnel were quick to replace the hair dryer. The air conditioner ran all night and was extremely loud. Carpet in the room was dirty and/or worn.  Close to Red Rocks I stay in Hampton Inns and Hilton Garden Inns regularly. This was one of the best Hampton Inns I have stayed in. It was very close to Red Rock Casino Resort, where I needed to be for a couple of days. Very convenient, plus was away from the casino energy at night and in the morning.    ",0.53,0.88,0.47,"""neutral"""," This was the first time I reserved a condo through Expedia.  There were many pro's but just as many con'sPro's: We had 2 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms. We had a full kitchen with a washer and dryer. Con's:The tub and sink in the master bath was slow draining.  There were only 6 towels for the entire week.  That would have been alright if the clothes dryer worked.  I stopped in and told the office that the dryer didn't heat up and it was never repaired during our stay.  There was a Publix grocery right next door which was good as there were no coffee filters or any paper products at all.  I didn't mind bringing the trash out to the dumpster daily but providing trash bags would have been nice. We had to purchase beach towels as there were none. I was also surprised that there was no hair dryer supplied.  I had to purchase that also. There was nothing complementary and with airlines charging for checked luggage, we tried to just bring carry ons.  That meant shopping for shampoo, toothpaste, lotion etc. In the future, I'll stick to hotels and skip the condo's. I like my fresh towels! First disappointing stay with Expedia.         Plenty of space to spreadout,  but not enough blankets, sheets had blonde hair on them (we are all brunettes!), tile floor was so dirty from months/year? not washing.  Carpet extremely old.    short drive to the beach . lots to do on property..pools tennis fishing   This is our sixth visit to Shorewalk Vacation Villas.  We enjoy coming here as the units are large and clean.  The grounds are beautifully maintained.   There are lots of wildlife around - turtles, beautiful birds.   It is very quiet and the staff is friendly.  The pool area is lovely and kept nice and neat.  My only complaint it the units are way too hot and they will only let you change the temperature a degree or two.  I tried to open the windows at night but they were locked .  I then opened up the door to the porch but a squirrel had chewed a hole in the screen and he tried coming in!!!Also, do not like you have to pay $10.00 for a pool pass.   You get the money back at the end but you have to wait for someone to come to give you the money back.  Very frustrating.   Would be much easier if we could just use our security passes at the pool.  We love vacationing here and hopefully will be able to come back next year.  I would strongly advise anyone to come to Shorewalk.    We have been staying here for years! If you don't need maid service, but want a quiet place to stay that is near to both the beach and the city, this is it. Several updates had bee made to our unit which were really nice. New flooring (eliminating the carpet), new counter tops, new microwave, and best of all separate, secure, internet access for each unit! There is an ongoing problem with the clothes dryers in the condos though. It can take 3 hours or more to dry a load due to the exhaust stacks being in need of cleaning.  This is OK place. This is my 10 time here on Shorwalk first time 1995 and the property have lost some of its beauty, but this is very good place fore family, good surroundings fore kids. The only thing I will dislake is the kitchen things, lot of thing is missing and the dishes have crack, glasses are few and so on. But the condos are many and next one is maby better.  Only thing we didn't like was that all the beds were roll away beds   Have been staying there since 2007.great place close to everything  Close to shopping, beach and restaurants. Great location.  We came for Golf and Fishing and we weren't disappointed. As it was 4 men together all we required was somewhere to hang our hat. I think if our wives had been there they may have found some faults. All in all we were satisfied.   Stayed here for daughter's wedding.  Needed a full kitchen as we made the wedding cake. Also needed a second bedroom. It was perfect for our needs. Close to all stores, close to wedding venue. A bit 8o's shabby, but clean and comfortable. Perfect round table in breakfast nook for decorating the cake.   I will definitely tell my friends and family members about your place.  We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back.   Everything was nice. Hope to stay at Shoe walk Vacation Villa on my next trip.  I have going there since 2007.This one of the BEST places I have ever stayed.I enjoy everthing about shorewalk villa.I give it a 5 stars.  This place is very good for the price you pay. Is close to the beach, surrounded by groceries stores and restaurants. Is quite, clean and great rates. Is not a luxury resort but have everything you need for a relaxing vacations. I will come back again and again.   enjoyed our stay. had all the supplies we needed for kitchen,bath and laundry. was very nice and comfortable. also had great ammenities pool,hot tub,basketball,fishing etc. and close to town and beaches. will book again next year.  My family and I were amazed how great this place was. We only spent 2 nights but will definitely consider another stay in our next vacation. Great place nice and quiet and plenty of room and things to do.   Had a great stay at the resort, we were not there long enough to get to see it all  Pleasant stay, quite & convenient to shopping, Beaches & Baseball field.  Decor a little dated, but very clean & kitchen well stocked w/ utensils! Stayed 6 nights, happy w/ everything.   Would come again, but would request unit near the pool!         The condo was located at The Palm section. The rooms were neat and clean, the bathrooms were spacious and clean. The only problem we had was a stove that didn't work properly. Publix, Aldi, restaurants, bowling alley are within walking distance. Coquina Beach is 15 minutes away.  You need to give a $10 deposit for a pool pass, which will be returned to you when you return it. Pool pass, use of ping pong tables ($20), and other ammenities require cash deposit. Retrieval and return only takes place at the club house, which opens at 10:00 a.m. The lady at the counter didn't have change, so we had to find $10 to get our money back on the last day. Overall, we had a great time, a homey place to come back to after a day at the beach with the option of staying in and cooking if you want.
